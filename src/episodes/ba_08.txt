Beautiful / Anonymous - Episode 121 - Prison Bound


Chris:        Hi, it's Chris Gethard. I notice you're about to listen to one of the back catalog episodes of Beautiful Anonymous. Just wanted to let you know the episode you are about to listen to was actually someone who we also did a follow up call with in our new series Beautiful Follow Ups. When you're done listening here if you want more from this caller, check out Beautiful Follow Ups and you can find more.
Chris:        Hello to all my shotgun grandmas. Beautiful/Anonymous one hour, one phone call, no names, no holds barred.
Chris:        Hello, hi. Hello to you listening. The one who's listening right now. It's me, it's Chris Gethard. Hi. Thanks for tuning in to Beautiful/Anonymous. I'm lucky to have you here. Really lucky to do this gig. It's best. It's the best thing. Get to talk to people from all over the world. Hear how they're doing. Hear what they're worried about. Hear what their concerns are of modern humanity. Hear about the lives that we're living. Thank you all for calling. Thanks for calling. I meet a lot of people, and I get a lot of tweets from people that are like "I always call, and I can never get through." Here's the best thing I can say to that, keep trying. I want to talk to all of you. I want to talk to every single one of you. Call every time I tweet out that number. I don't want to stop doing this show until every single one of you has had a chance to be on it. I mean that sincerely.
Chris:        Okay. What do I have to tell you guys about? Some big things coming up, some big things coming up. We have couple live tapings in the works, and tickets are on sale, so I want to mention it because I don't want them to sell out before you guys hear about them. July 27th we have a live taping of Beautiful/Anonymous in Montreal, Canada, part of the Just for Laughs Festival. Me and Jared, we're flying up to Canada. Bought the tickets last week. Gonna head up to Canada. It's going to be a good time. That's the best festival in the world. It is. I've done that one, Edinburgh, I'd love to do the Melbourne one. Those are regarded as all the best ones. Right? Just For Laughs is great. I'm also doing standup there the 26th, the 28th, my full hour. So if you're coming to town for the taping, maybe you come see me do some standup, too. Make it a whole little Gethard week up there in Canada.
Chris:        We also are going to be doing the London Podcast Festival in September. And tickets are already moving, I've noticed. Our UK fans, last time I was in the UK a lot of people were really so nice about Beautiful/Anonymous. We're coming. London, we're finally coming. Live taping in London. You go check out Chrisgeth.com for those tickets, or you go check out the Just for Laughs site, or the London Podcast Festival site. Get those tickets. We've got these tapings coming, baby.
Chris:        Now, last week's episode, Out of the Closet, young person who had not spoken very much about his sexuality was telling us "Yep. I'm on the brink. I'm ready to go. I'm comfortable. I'm going to come out. I'm going to let the people in my world know what's going on." I found it very touching, and very personal, and beautiful, and I just hope I was there for the caller. Some people in the Facebook group did set me straight on something, which is not great phrasing, I apologize, but did let me know one thing. I had said, at one point "I hope that we live in a world that if you come out to your folks that they just go 'All right, yeah. What do you want for dinner?'" Some people did say to me "Hey, that's a little reductive because it is a big deal. It is a big deal." And I apologize if anyone felt like I was being dismissive. I was more speaking of the idea that I would love if we lived in a world where it wasn't a big deal. And I think we're heading more towards that, and I hope someday, every kid, just someday, can go out and go on dates with who they want and nobody blinks twice, because who cares.
Chris:        Anyway. Here's a comment I read that I thought was really beautiful. It was from someone named Kyra in the Facebook group. This summed up a lot of the comments that were coming in all at once. "I listened to this episode while on an impromptu road trip to my 20th class reunion, which I found fitting. As someone born in South Dakota, I was baffled by the lack of enthusiasm for Mount Rushmore. A lot of Mount Rushmore fans out there coming to the defense of Mount Rushmore. Someone who lived in Montana for 20 years, I was howling about the discussion on laws, or lack there of. As a human, I was captivated by the caller and his story. I hope he comes out when he's ready. I hope the people in his life embrace him with love, acceptance, and joy. I hope he knows there's so many of us who have his back, who believe that love is love. I hope he lives his truth, whatever that looks like for him. If you're reading this, caller, don't wait. Just yesterday I was an insecure, awkward, emotional high schooler who was just doing her best like everyone else. Last night I celebrated 20 years with people who knew me before I knew myself. It goes by in a blink. Do not waste another moment living anything but your truth. And remember, love always wins." Beautiful comment.
Chris:        Okay. This week's episode. I tell you, we've been sitting on this one for a few months, and I have not been able to stop thinking about it. I ran home. I told Haley, I just had one of the conversations of my life. And that's not a pissing contest between the others. It's so specific, and so unique. Also, sadly, because of some stuff, it's a little more common than I think we like to admit with some of the epidemic driven side of it. You may have, it's an episode people got so excited about. A lot of the other EarWolf shows have been running ads about it. You may have heard the, at the end of last week's episode, teaser for it. The AV club ran a little exclusive on it. You may know a little bit about it.
Chris:        If you don't, I'm not going to say any specifics in the intro, just because if you don't know what's coming, I want you to be as blindsided as I was. This is about as intense a call as we've ever had. And that's coming from me. I've been here for all of them. There's been some intense ones. I know that. And you know that. But this one, I'm telling you, I've said it since the moment we hung up the phone. They pay Hollywood screenwriters millions of dollars to come up with stories that this person just has. You couldn't invent something more intense, and more unique, than what this caller is going through. I can't believe this caller gave us an hour of her time when she didn't have that many hours to spare. You're going to see what I mean. Buckle up is my advice to you. If you're right now, if you're one of those people who casually listens, not today. Not today. If you're doing dishes, stop doing them for second, okay? If you're driving, just be ready to put your hazard lights on, because you might be unable to focus on the road. This one is something else you guys. It's something else. Tell everybody about this one, because it's going to be a lot of people, I think, are going to go "Whoa. This show just went somewhere new." Enjoy it.
Speaker 2:        Thank you for calling Beautiful/Anonymous. A beeping noise will indicate when you are on the show with the host.
Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Hi.
Caller:        Hi. Is this Chris?
Chris:        This is Chris.
Caller:        How are you this morning?
Chris:        How am I this morning? I'm good. I just took a Brazilian Jujitsu class. 7:30 am. Bright and early. Great way to start the day, getting beat up. Feeling really good, and awake, and alive.
Caller:        That was not my idea of a great morning. I am not a morning person at all.
Chris:        Well, I have a lot of self hatred issues. How are you?
Caller:        Well, I'm as good as can be. I'm a lot better than people expect me to be.
Chris:        That's an intriguing answer.
Caller:        Well, I am kind of living my own version of Orange is the New Black. On Monday my parents and I are taking a road trip, which will end with me turning myself in to federal prison for 46 months.
Chris:        For almost four years?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        Wow. Wow. That's, I need to know everything about this. And right off the bat, let me say, I imagine this isn't the easiest thing to talk about, so thanks for opening up.
Caller:        It isn't, but in some ways it is. I actually feel like there's been a lot of people that have heard my story that it's helped, and I thought maybe more people can hear it and get something from it.
Caller:        I, unfortunately, took a path of, I didn't start out, let me start with that. I started out in a medical career, doing very well. I had some traumatic things happen in my life, which I turned to drugs to help with. And led me to selling drugs to support my habit. April 22nd of last year we had our door kicked in by pretty much all of a alphabet forms of law enforcement. DEA, ATF, and I got a federal indictment. I've been clean since June 15th, 2017, and trying to change my life around. Which I have successfully done. I have been involved in NA, I've lived in sober living. Spoken to people who are struggling. But just because I changed my life, and done things the right way from that point to now, doesn't mean I'm absolved of the crimes I did when I was getting high. It doesn't mean I don't get to face those consequences. So that's what I'm about to do.
Chris:        Wow. I have to say, this one's already blowing my mind. First of all, very sincerely, I know it's under particularly extreme circumstances, but congrats on being clean since June, first of all.
Caller:        Thank you.
Chris:        No matter the circumstances, I have to say, I have to imagine that if i talked to you in March of last year, I have to imagine you wouldn't be so clear headed.
Caller:        Oh, absolutely not.
Chris:        Can I ask what kind of drugs you were deep into?
Caller:        My drug of choice was methamphetamine. I also did cocaine, and mushrooms. Pretty much anything that would change my reality. Anything that would make me not feel what was going on.
Chris:        Yeah. Here's my initial instinct, and you're going to have to correct me on all this stuff, because we see TV shows, and we see movies about drugs, and indictments. Right away in my head I'm like "Wow, is this like Breaking Bad?" Were you manufacturing meth? For this to be a federal level crime, you must have been-
Caller:        I was trafficking. I was working with some, unfortunately, very dangerous people, and I realize now how dangerous the lifestyle I had gotten into. I was trafficking for the cartel.
Chris:        The Mexican Cartel?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        And was this, was it meth that you were trafficking?
Caller:        Yes. And cocaine.
Chris:        Meth and cocaine. Were you getting it back and forth over the boarder?
Caller:        It was being delivered to me from Mexico, and then my husband and I were distributing it in our town. About a pound a day is what we were distributing.
Chris:        A pound a day?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        You were part of an international drug syndicate?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        And you were a cog that sounds like it was not, you weren't at the bottom of the chain. You weren't at the very top, but you were a mid level, this is pretty far up the chain.
Caller:        Yeah. I was, well, on our federal indictment, there were three people on our indictment. My husband, myself, and our supplier. There were only three of us. We had a pretty large operation. Unfortunately, we were the second people up in our operation. That kind of got us some unwanted attention, and brought us some pretty big consequences.
Chris:        Yeah. Are you and your husband still married?
Caller:        Yes. We've been together for, I'll tell you, drugs ruins lives, and it ruins relationships. We are happier right now than we've ever been in the seven years we've been together. We officially got married on New Year's Eve because we're both going to prison, and that's the only way we could communicate, is if we were legally married. He's actually sitting across the room from me right now. When they first served the federal indictment, they put a no contact order. Which meant we couldn't have phone calls, we couldn't write letters. They sent me to a rehab that was pretty far away, and he got to stay where we were. For almost six months we weren't able to contact each other. When that no contact order was lifted, it was a pretty great day. We were both living in sober living homes, so we couldn't live together. I was able to spend three nights a week with him, and then four nights at my sober living home. But it's brought us closer than I think we've ever been. And really showed us what's important and what matters. Because at the blink of an eye you could lose everything.
Chris:        Wow. I have so many questions. I'm just going to go for it.
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        Tell me when I'm offending you, and or if you're like "If I answer that question a cartel might hear it, and I'd rather not go there." The only time I've had to say that in the history of the show. You and your husband have been together seven years. Were you both into drugs seven years ago when you met?
Caller:        No. Actually, he had some drug history in his past. I did not. I had focused on my career. He had been clean for quite a while. We drank together. It was a situation where someone had brought some speed to a party, and it kind of triggered him, and he relapsed, and then I tried it, and we were just off and running from there.
Chris:        Wow. It was like an overnight thing.
Caller:        It literally, in a matter of three years, we went from using a little bit every other weekend, to kind of just hang out, and have good time. To every weekend. And within six months we were using every single day. And couldn't get through a day without using. Which then cost us our jobs. He had a business that he was very successful at, he owned five small businesses that his work started to not get done, not get done as well as he was able to before, so he started losing customers and not making the money. And I lost my job at the hospital. So then we started selling so we could support our habit and pay our bills.
Chris:        Wow. And were you a nurse?
Caller:        I was an ICU tech, and an EKG tech, so I did the EKGs and monitored the people in ICE, monitored their heart rhythms, did their EKGs. Called the doctor if anything was changing.
Chris:        Yeah. It sounds like you were, if I'm doing the math right, a couple years together clean, fell into this pit for a few years, came out of it, and you got married two months ago. After the indictment.
Caller:        Yes. We got married on New Year's Eve at 11:50. There was a mass wedding in the town that we were in that a judge was doing. We were like "Hey, let's go do that."
Chris:        It's like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde. You're outlaw lovers.
Caller:        Kind of. We were, you know, a lot of people look up to us now because we've, throughout all this, we hear almost daily "If I was about to go to prison I'd probably be out there getting high." I'm like "It doesn't help anything." There are definitely moments where the disease of addiction rears it's head and says "You're already going to prison. Go get high. Go not feel this for a little while." But I know that if I do that, I not only can't look at the people that I've been helping through this, the people I've mentored, I can't look at myself in the mirror and have any respect for myself when I go to serve this time.
Chris:        Right. Right. What a beautiful attitude. I have to say, for someone who's about to, because you said you go in on Monday to turn yourself in?
Caller:        Yeah. It's about an 11 hour drive to get to the prison where I'm going. My parents are going to pick me up from my husband's house on Monday morning, and we're kind of going to take a two day road trip. I have to turn myself in by 2:00 pm on the 7th.
Chris:        For someone who's a couple days away from turning yourself in for a four year prison sentence, you sound remarkably upbeat and positive.
Caller:        You know, there are moments where I kind of just cry, but like I said, just because I've changed my life for the better, doesn't mean that I'm absolved of my past. It doesn't mean that I don't still have to make those amends. And for me, those amends are going and paying my debt to society and serving this time. I just plan on taking advantage of so many programs that are offered in the prison. I can go and further my education. I can get healthy. There's counseling that I can take advantage of. I can really focus on bettering myself. And having that time to do it. And I'll have the clarity of being clean for almost nine months on top of that.
Chris:        Wow. What an amazing attitude. What an amazing attitude. There's a lot of things to criticize about the American prison system, the parole system, the cycle of criminality that a lot of people say it encourages. It sounds like you're really dedicated to the idea of rehabilitation is the lip service they say about it, and you're going to really make sure that that's what it is for you.
Caller:        That's my plan. You know, something I will say in all of this, the prison system on the federal level is a lot different than the state to state. I've noticed in all this, there's not much focus, anywhere, on mental health, and there's just, you lock people up, and put them in prison, where if they would focus on mental health, and funneling some money into mental health, the drug problem and the criminal problem from the drug problems would just dramatically lower. There's so many people who are just self medicating mental issues with drugs. I mean, it's so sad. I keep seeing budget cuts for mental health. People that really need help relying on going and just getting high.
Chris:        Yeah. I mean, I think there's so many stigmas against mental health, that it's probably easier for, you know, when the fear of that coming sets in, I'd have to imagine there's some people who self medicate, and it's probably easier to swallow for people going "Hey, you party too hard." Versus saying "Hey, you're a little crazy." I'd have to imagine that is a pretty big thing out there.
Caller:        I know. Most of the people in recovery recognize that they have mental health issues that are underlying to their drug addiction. I think that that's something that, if we had focused more on getting people help, and having more programs for people as far as recovery, and sober living, and just support for people who need help, I think that our population in the prisons would go down. People would be more productive. I mean, I was not a productive member of society. I was just out there. I wasn't the kind of person who was going and stealing to support my habit. I mean, because we were selling enough that that wasn't a problem. But I definitely contributed so much to people ruining their lives, and I didn't really care. As long as I was being paid, I didn't care where you were getting the money to come and buy drugs from me.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        And that is something that I regret so much because selling that much, and putting that much drugs on the street, I know that my children suffered. I lost my children because of my addiction. And I know that so many other children lost their parents because I was putting drugs out there. And that's a huge regret for me.
Chris:        Wow. You know, I think the obvious thing that a lot of people listening probably have in their heads, point of reference probably Breaking Bad, based on what you're describing. That's the thing that keeps, I hate to compare it to pop culture, but that's the way of the world, right? You've had the real life moments of someone keeps coming to your door, and you've watched them degrade physically and mentally.
Caller:        Oh, absolutely.
Chris:        Where you just see a person become living zombie in a living hell?
Caller:        I was that. I would stay up for five days on end, and you know, psychologically, your brain just can't handle that. You start getting suspicious of everything. You start thinking the craziest thoughts. Me and my husband, we had a great relationship, we were kind of the model couple before drugs, and we would spend maybe an hour together, and that was, honestly, just to have sex, and then we would separate. He would go his way, and I would go my way, and we would just ... That was just the way it was. You always had to be suspicious because when the DEA raided us, we have three and a half pounds of methamphetamine. When you have that much drugs around, you always have to be careful of who's coming through the door, and what they're going to try to get.
Chris:        Yeah. Were people trying to rob you all the time? Was that a constant fear?
Caller:        It wasn't. I'm probably one of the nicest people you would meet, but when I'm on drugs, my husband and I are both very scary individuals. I always had a gun. Everybody knew that I was able to shoot very well. I was very accurate with a pistol. That wasn't really a fear. People would try more to, a lot of times they would try to get in between me and my husband and get us to be suspicious of each other so they could take advantage of that and get more, or kind of, it was just a lot of people were out, just up to no good.
Chris:        Just kind of undermine.
Caller:        Exactly.
Chris:        Wow. And again, I'm just going to ask all the questions. There might be things where you go, that involves other crime, and I shouldn't speak to it. Did you ever have to point a gun at someone? Hearing someone as chipper on the phone as you say the phrase "Everyone knew I was good with the pistol." Is chilling. And that's just your real life. You just dropped that causally, because that's just at true thing. For me, I'm like "Holy shit."
Caller:        There was, the only time that I ever, I actually took gun courses. I love-
Chris:        Hello?
Caller:        Are you still there? Can you hear me?
Chris:        Yes. Hello. Yes.
Caller:        Okay. Sorry. I must have hit a dead spot in my house.
Chris:        That's okay.
Caller:        I love to shoot. I used to go to the firing range, and that used to be something that was fun. Unfortunately I'll never be able to do that again. The only time that I ever really pulled a gun on anybody was our cartel person came in and he was upset. There was a disagreement about something. He came in while my husband was gone, so it was just me, and he made some threats. He basically said "No. This is how things are going to be. And if you don't like it, we can go outside and bang this out right now." And I had my Glock on my hip, and I said "No one wants that to come to this, but if that's what we have to do, I guarantee you I'll shoot you between your eyes before you can get your gun out of your waistband."
Chris:        And how does he respond to that?
Caller:        He kind of stands there in a little bit of shock because he's a very scary person that doesn't usually have anybody talk back to him. My husband walks in to me and our supplier, and our supplier's body guard, kind of in a Mexican stand off situation. And he's like "What did you do?" I'm sorry. I just said my name.
Chris:        Oh, believe me. We'll bleep that. We got your back on that. If there's anyone whose name needs to be bleeped, you're the most pressing one in a long time on this show. Wow. Wow. And do you keep working with that cartel guy after that incident?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        And do you guys have a conversation when things calm down? Or do you just sort of always live with the constant tension that you recently threatened to shoot each other between the eyes?
Caller:        Well, my husband came home, and the guy immediately looks at my husband and says "We need to go talk." They went out to the garage and had a conversation, and my husband came back in and he's like "I can't believe you did that, but I'm so proud of you because he's always going to have respect for you." In that world, you get respect by actually standing up for yourself. If you let somebody walk all over you, then you have no legs to stand on. No one's going to respect you. No one's going to take anything that you say seriously. And then that's when you have to worry about being robbed, or something happening to you.
Chris:        Now did the cartel know that you guys were getting high off your own supply, as the Notorious BIG would say?
Caller:        Yes, and they honesty, they want that. Because then you're always going to, if you're getting high and you're addicted to it, then they don't ever have to worry about losing you.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        As long as you're paying them the money you owe them, they don't care.
Chris:        It sounds legitimately too, I would have to imagine this is the reality of if you start overdoing it to the point where you're not, if you're doing enough of your own drugs that you can no longer pay them, they can just throw your body in a desert and find another addict to take your place. That has to be the reality, right?
Caller:        Absolutely. It absolutely is. I've witnessed things that were-
Chris:        Hello? You've witnessed things that were what? Well, if that ain't a cliffhanger, I don't know what is. What did she witness? Will we even reestablish this connection? The ultimate cliffhanger. Is this call cut off forever? You'll have to come back after the ads to find that one out.
Chris:        Thank you so much to our advertisers for supporting the show. Guys, good news. We reestablished the connection. Enjoy the rest of this call.
Chris:        You've witnessed things that were what?
Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Yes. You've witnessed things that were what? I need to know what you've witnessed?
Caller:        I mean, I've witnessed people being tortured over $700.
Chris:        What do you mean tortured?
Caller:        There was a girl who stole $700, who was pulled out of bed while she was sleeping, wrapped in plastic, had the acetone thrown on her. Was beat with a pistol. It was a very scary situation. I remember just sitting in another room with my husband going "What did we get ourselves into?" It was just too late. We were in over our heads.
Chris:        Did this happen at your turf, or were you traveling with the cartel?
Caller:        It happened in our house. They had found out that she was there, and she had taken some money, so they came and got her. It was in the next room over from my bedroom.
Chris:        Was it a friend of yours? Or someone who you were selling to?
Caller:        It was someone that I knew vaguely that we were going to rent a room to. I didn't know her very well.
Chris:        And then the cartel catches wind of it, goes "Actually, that's a person we've been looking for. We're going to come over and pistol whip her, and throw acid on her."?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        And then what? You gotta get out the carpet cleaner and clean up after that? It's your house.
Caller:        Yeah, we just kind of had to, there were some holes in the wall that had to be patched. There was an awful smell that had to be taken care of. Just cleaned it up, she was gone, and you just went about your life afterwards.
Chris:        And she just, she lived? She just went on her way battered and burnt?
Caller:        Yes, she did live. She left, and I never heard from her again, obviously. She didn't want to hear from me.
Chris:        Yeah, I'm sure the phone's not ringing and her being like "So, is that room still available?" It's time for her to move on. Wow. You've seen some dangerous things, and been around some dangerous people.
Caller:        And you know, that's, it's so crazy how if you would have met me six years ago, I was not the person who used drugs. I was so anti even smoking marijuana. And then just the right set of circumstances happened, and I just spun off out of control. And you know, my husband and I don't look like, I mean, we look like a suburban couple. And that was what the cartel really liked. We weren't suspicious driving around because we just looked like a soccer mom and dad.
Chris:        Yeah. Wow. And, I'm sure at some point your friends and family have to start realizing that there's something going on?
Caller:        You cut yourself off from anybody who's not in that lifestyle. I stopped talking to my parents. I didn't get reconnected with my mom and dad until I was in rehab. Because that's not, you know that they'll know something, and you know they're not going to approve. My father is a Baptist minister, and my mom's the choir director, so that's not the life that they had envisioned for me at all. I didn't grow up that way, I grew up in church, going to church camp. That's just, so I definitely didn't let them know, because I just didn't contact them. I kind of just fell off the map.
Chris:        Wow. I mean, for most calls, if someone said "I once witnessed a woman being pistol whipped, and burned via acid by a Mexican Cartel member." That's the full hour. With you, that was a 30 second aside.
Caller:        Yeah. There was just, that lifestyle is awful. It's unfortunate what people will do over the smallest things.
Chris:        Wow. Do you know how you got caught?
Caller:        I don't know exactly who, I mean, someone told on us, but when they set up the sting, there were pictures taken from a neighbors house that was empty, that they had kind of moved into, and were surveilling us from that. I don't know the person who did, and I don't want to know. Because that person ultimately was probably trying to save themselves. They probably had a little bit of dope, and then to cover and get out of that, they were like "Oh, I know where the big people are." I don't wish any unwell because they honestly saved our lives. They saved our relationship, they made things better for us. Even though, in a few days I'm leaving my husband and going to prison, we are happier right now than we have ever been.
Chris:        Wow. I mean, what an amazing attitude, and what a quick turnaround. This was June. The popular perception is that you would want to find whoever ratted you out, and give them the what for. As they would say.
Caller:        And that was definitely our first instinct. We wanted to know who it was, and we were going to go after them because they ruined everything. Our friends that we supposedly had, we had a nice three bedroom house that had TVs in every room. We had computers, we had tools, we had cars. I mean, we had so much stuff that we didn't appreciate, we didn't even care about. That as soon as the US Marshalls came and picked us up, and took us away on that Federal Indictment, just everybody just came. It was a free for all, and just took everything. Now, my husband and I have, basically, a couple duffle bags full of clothes. That's what we have. And a TV.
Chris:        Wow. You were getting high, but you were also making money. You guys were splitting the difference.
Caller:        Yeah. We were making enough money that we had two money counters.
Chris:        Two money counters?
Caller:        The bank style that counts your bills.
Chris:        Yeah, one money counter couldn't keep up with the amount of money you had to count?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        That's what it's built for. Wow. This is blowing my mind. This is blowing my mind. Do you know anyone else who's been to prison? Have you been able to get advice from people from that perspective?
Caller:        I actually, a sober living home that we went to, it's a nationwide organization, I won't mention the name of it, because anybody who hears that will know who I am. I immediately got involved in just trying to help other people who were coming through. There's a lot of people who come from prison and go into sober living the try and change their life. It's definitely an organization that does that. I immediately got involved. I became the president of my house. Each house is ran by the people who live there. There's no management or anything like that. You hold each other accountable. There's probably between seven and twelve people in each house.
Caller:        I became house president. There were people that were coming and and looking to me to do the right thing. That was one thing that kept me from messing up, was other people were looking up to me. I got involved in the chapter, which there's about eight houses in a chapter. I was vice chair for the chapter to help other houses. And then I got involved in my regional level, started speaking, and that's really what kept me on the right path. Through that I met a lot of people that have been through prison, and they're like "You got this. Go in clear headed. Don't cause any trouble, keep your head down."
Chris:        Wow. Yeah, I mean, you know there's the stereotypes of prison that they get violent, that there's gangs, that you have to link up with people with similar demographics as you. Is this, on the federal level is that less of a factor? Is it more, are these super max type prisons, more regulated than that, or is there a real fear there?
Caller:        There is that fear there, but the biggest advice I've gotten is don't get in debt with anyone, and don't disrespect anyone. Which I'm not that type of person. There's something that they say "Don't eat the candy bar, and don't take the chips." Because people aren't there to be nice to you. No one's going to give you something and not expect something in return.
Chris:        Right. They're testing your naïveté.
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        This is, I have never, I never imagined I'd talk to somebody in your situation. What's it like when, I mean, do you, are you guys living the life, you're getting high, so you're in an altered reality, you got all this money, this has been going on for years and building, do you feel invincible? Is it a surprise when the doors get kicked in? Or are you like "It finally happened?"
Caller:        It was kind of a combination of both. You do feel invincible. You feel like this is going to go on forever, that everything's going to be great. That you've got money, you've got power, everybody is under you. There's that, you do feel invincible. But it had gotten to the point where no matter how high we got we were so miserable. We hated ourselves, and we hated everybody else as well. That's just what the drug does to you. It steals everything. You start getting high so that you don't feel those negative feelings, to take that away, and it gives you a false sense of joy. But as your addiction grows, it takes everything away. You can't feel anything. You can't feel happy. You can't feel sad. You just don't feel anything.
Chris:        Yeah. I mean, I would never compare to your situation, obviously, I'm not saying it's very similar, but I was once prescribed Adderall, and went nuts, and started abusing it, and taking it too much. And that's in the amphetamine family. That is an amphetamine salt. I can say even that, I felt like a golden god who never needed to sleep or eat. I was better at being social, I was quicker and funnier than I usually am. And I'm a professional comedian, a pretty funny guy, I'm willing to admit. Even with that, but then my muscles were always spasming. It went from people being like "Oh, you lost weight." To people, within a month people being "Hey, you lost weight. What the fuck is going on?" I had lost that much weight. Started pooping blood. It was weird. The whole thing was weird. Anyway.
Caller:        It's that, a lot of people, I also abused Adderall. I didn't see that as, when I was in college, I would take Adderall because it was finals week, and I'd take a couple Adderall to get through studying, and get through finals, because I was working graveyard shift and then going to school during the day. I thought that was okay. I didn't realize until now that that was the beginning of my addiction. I was binge drinking, I was using Adderall occasionally when I thought I needed it. But that was the beginning dark days. And then years later, I tried meth and was like "Oh my God, this is the best thing ever. I can get my house clean, and I can do these projects, I can do this, and I can do that." And then that goes away to where, I couldn't get a single thing done in a day because I would have to go and smoke a bowl before I could go do my laundry. And then that one bowl would turn into me sitting there for hours. And then at 2 o'clock in the morning going "Oh, I was supposed to do laundry." You would start and stop so many projects, and you would think you were getting a lot done, you had all this energy. In reality, you would lose days and not have accomplished a thing.
Chris:        You were like wake and baking with meth?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        Geeze. Geeze. When you went to trial, was your initial instinct "We gotta fight this. We gotta find a loophole, we gotta find a way out."? Or had you hit a point, you're feeling, it's so commendable, and so beautiful to hear you basically say "No, I did a lot of stuff. Hurt a lot of people's lives on top of my own. Time to pay the penance, and I'm okay paying that penance." Was that a quick attitude, or did you try to fight it initially?
Caller:        At first, I did. The way it happened was when, it was 1 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, and my husband and I had actually finally laid down to get a couple hours sleep, and we woke up to the worst sound you could ever imagine. It was the battering ram hitting our front door. And we both sat up and looked at the cameras, and saw people in full tactical gear, the SWAT team style, shield, shotguns, coming through the door, and going "Oh my God. This is real." Immediately we looked at each other, and the next thing we know is there's someone coming down the hall and they're coming down the hall one at a time, hand on the person in front of them shoulder, yelling for everybody to come out of the rooms and putting zip ties on us and setting us in the living room. It was just, that moment, I was like "They don't have anything. They didn't do a proper ..." I was trying to find any loophole. And then the state dropped their case, and the feds picked it up. And when the feds picked it up, the government doesn't pick up a case they can't win. That's why they have a 98% conviction rate on the federal level. They just won't pick it up, they'll let the state take care of it if they can't win it. When the feds picked it up, I was like "Okay."
Caller:        Originally, before I was given the opportunity to better myself, our charges were a 10 year minimum, lifetime maximum. It was 10 to life was what we thought we were going to have to do.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        We were very fortunate that they sent us to rehab and gave us an opportunity. And the judge that we were assigned is huge on recovery. We were able to get our minimum dropped to I'll do, you have to do 85% of your time, so I'll actually do a little over three years on a 46 month sentence, and then I'll have to do five years probation.
Chris:        And that's the type of thing that gets shortened for good behavior. And I would imagine that if you do enter a lot of educational programs, and use a lot of the rehabilitating focused services that that all adds up to getting those months shaved off?
Caller:        The 46 months, I will absolutely have to do a little over three years of that. I won't get any more time shaved off of that. In state level, you can get a 20 year sentence, and only do five out of 20. There's not a whole lot of truth in sentencing in state prisons. In federal, there's laws that say what you get sentenced is what you're getting. There's no back and forth. You do 85% of it. You get 54 days a year of good time.
Chris:        Yeah. Now, I have to ask. You mentioned something that I've been hesitant to ask about. You mentioned that you lost your kids.
Chris:        Let's go ahead and pause. That's a tough question. Always gotta ask the tough questions around here, right? We're going to get the answers to those questions, and many more. Come back. In the meantime, we've got advertisers. Check out what they have to offer. Use the promo codes. It helps the show when you do. We'll be right back.
Chris:        Thanks again to all of our advertisers. And now, the conclusion of one of the most epic phone calls this show has ever seen.
Chris:        Now, I have to ask, you mentioned something that I've been hesitant to ask about. You mentioned that you lost your kids.
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        How many kids do you have?
Caller:        I have two. I have a 19 year old son, and a 13 year old son.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        I have seen them a few times since all of this has happened, and I had a very tough conversation with my 13 year old, where he basically said "Mom, either step into my life and be a part of my life, or don't." My ex husband is remarried, and there's two parents living in the home. He's like "It's too hard for me to go back and forth. It's too hard for me to have you for a little bit and lose you." Knowing that I'm going to prison, and hearing him say that, and having that "Okay, well, I'm going away." I told him how much I love him, and how much I regret. I was never, I never thought I was being a bad mom. I was an inattentive mom. I wasn't reliable. I went from being one of the team moms to the baseball team and football team, always being there, to just not being present for them. I would show up late to pick them up, or I would have to get high first. Or I wouldn't go because I didn't want them to see me high.
Caller:        I definitely, in my addiction, I started choosing drugs over my children. I never thought I would be that person. It hurts a lot to know that I turned into that type of person. Because I was always very judgemental on anyone who would choose anything over their kids. But that, absolutely addiction took over. I wasn't able to care about anything else except for getting high. It just stole everything.
Chris:        Were they ever in the house when you were dealing, or when any of this violence was happening?
Caller:        No. They were gone by then. I was always, I was high when they were around. We had joint custody, my ex husband and I, and so when they would come over, I would spend hours in the bathroom getting high, and just saying "Oh, I don't feel well." I had battled with a serious illness, and I used that as an excuse to my kids of why I was in the bedroom and not around, because I didn't feel well. And they accepted that excuse because they didn't know any better, and they had never been around anything like this. But I never had any of those people around the kids, or anything like that.
Caller:        I kind of, as my addiction got worse, my ex husband was like "Unless you get help, you can't be around the kids. I'm not going to have them around this. I'm not going to have them around you high." When he said that, I was like devastated, so I started getting high more so I wouldn't feel that disappointment, and that's when things really started spiraling. Was when I, instead of going and getting help for my addiction because I was losing my kids, I used more drugs to not feel anything over losing my kids.
Chris:        That's brutal. That's brutal. So, your ex husband did pick up on what was going on?
Caller:        Yes. He did.
Chris:        It sounds like he was one of the only ones.
Caller:        Yeah. And I, I thought I was so well at hiding it. Looking back now, I had all the classic, what they call tweaker ticks. I'd always have, my jaw was moving, I was moving my body in irregular movements, and I couldn't sit still. Just classic that person's high. I see it now, and I'm like "Oh, God, was I like that?" And I was.
Chris:        Wow. Were you, do you live in the southwest, I imagine, if this is a matter of the Mexican Cartel getting stuff over the border?
Caller:        I can say my state. I'm in Oklahoma.
Chris:        In Oklahoma? Is meth a big problem there?
Caller:        Meth is a huge problem here. Heroine is starting to be a problem. Meth is, everybody has access to it. Everybody can make it. Unfortunately, what you make isn't as good a quality as what we had. It's something that I know more people that have dabbled in meth than haven't. And it seems like as I'm going into these sober living homes, when you ask people their drug of choice, it's pretty much at least 80% of the people who are going through recovery meth was their drug of choice.
Chris:        That's an insidious thing. That's a really brutal thing. Wow. 13 year old, what's that? Eighth grade? And 19, your son's in college?
Caller:        My son graduates from high school this year, and is going on to college.
Chris:        You must be proud.
Caller:        I am very proud of him. He's a great kid. He has goals, he's never messed, he's never done the wrong thing. He's always been that kid that's trying to do the right thing. Unfortunately for me, because he has this very high moral code, he's having a hard time forgiving me. He doesn't really want to speak to me, and I completely understand. And hopefully, as I have more clean time, as he can see me changing my life, that will change. But he's just, he holds himself to a high moral standard, and of course holds his parents and everybody around him to that same standard. It's very difficult for him to come to terms with the things that I've done.
Chris:        Yeah, sounds like a good kid. And I'm sure your names must have been in the paper and stuff, too, so he's old enough that he has to, it sounds like your younger son is young enough that I imagine there's a lot of teasing and stuff when you're 13, but your older son has a much clearer picture of how nuts this was.
Caller:        Yes. And he saw it. Someone posted something on Facebook about it, and that's how he found out. And he was just so angry. I've talked to him a couple of times. I spent Christmas with them. When I got sentenced, I got sentenced January 24th, and they gave us until March 7th to get our affairs in order, do what we had to do. This last 45 days has kind of been pretty surreal. It's like what do you do if you only have 45 days of freedom left? How do you spend that? You don't want to spend any money because you want to save up as much money as you can to take with you, so it's like, I've pretty much just gone about my life as normal, and spent as much time with my husband as I can. Tried to reconnect with my children. It's just been, it's very surreal. You count down the days, and then you wake up and it's four days away, and you're like "Okay, what am I going to do the next four days?" And part of you just wants to go get it over with, because the faster you start the faster it's done. But the other part wants to wait until that last moment. Get every minute of freedom that you can.
Chris:        Right. As you say that, I feel like mine would revolve 90% around food. I feel like I'd be traveling around eating all the food that I like. I'd be like "I gotta get some good Indian food. I'm not going to have it for four years." Food would be the big one for me.
Caller:        We went for a steak dinner the other night. We've been eating a lot of fast food. A lot of fast food. I don't know when I'm going to get McDonald's again.
Chris:        I'm sure. Those Wendy's chicken nuggets. Get the Taco Bell right now.
Caller:        Yes. It has been a lot of food. I can't look at Ramen Noodles. I usually like those. It's a good, easy thing to warm up for if you're hungry, but I mean, I can't think of eating those right now, because that's what I'm going the have for the next four years.
Chris:        Yeah. I have a tough question. How do your kids feel about your new husband?
Caller:        There is some animosity there because I did start using with him, and because we got in all this trouble together. It's going to take a lot of work to rebuild the relationship.
Chris:        Right. I can't imagine they were thrilled when you guys got married after getting arrested together.
Caller:        Yes. And that's something, you know, in addiction, relationships typically don't work. We've been to counseling and all that stuff. Our individual counselors talked very seriously to us about relationships don't work, and typically you guys will relapse together. I'm like, we are not, there have been more times for me, definitely. He is like, I don't know, I'm looking at him right now and he's giving me a weird look. He has this amazing resolve of "Drugs took too much from me to ever give anything to them again." For me, I've had these moments of "I just want to get high and not feel anything. I'm going to prison anyway." He's like "Do you really want to feel that way after? You're not going to be able to get high and feel good. There's no way. You're going to get high, and you're going to be mad, and you're going to be, and then you're just going to be stuck awake with all these feelings."
Chris:        Right. Because I guess the question is, when you get out of prison, and six, seven years from now, if, God forbid, one of you does fall back into it, are you going to have the strength to look the other person in the eye and say either "I have to get away from you." Or "You have to get away from me."?
Caller:        That's where it's going to be hard. We've had very serious discussions about that, and if either one of us falls off and does the wrong thing, we know that we can't be together and do that. I mean, and it's very easy to say "Well, we're clean." And I think the more time clean we have will make it less of a risk. But I think that that's a very real fear for both of us, is if the other one messes up and starts using again, are we going to be able to not follow them down that path and start this all over again, and get them the help that they need.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        I think we've built up a huge support system through, I mean, we're very involved in Narcotics Anonymous and we've met so many amazing people with amazing stories that have been just holding us up through this whole time like "You've got this. Keep your head up." I just, if anything happened to where one of us messed up, there's so many people that will rally around and help us.
Chris:        Yeah, the gravity of all this keeps setting in the more and more the longer we talk. We hear a lot of real life stories on this show, and this is one of the realest we've ever had.
Caller:        You know, when I called and left the voice mail, my hope was both for somebody who's struggling with addiction to hear this and know that you don't have to be a prisoner to that life. Go find a Narcotics Anonymous meeting and just sit and listen. Addicts who have gotten clean are some of the most loving people, and they will just wrap you up, and get you help, and be there, and listen, take you for a cup of coffee, and feed you. Please, if you are struggling, just go sit in an NA meeting. It will help.
Caller:        Also, for some of your listeners, there's so much of astigmatism, or stigma-
Chris:        Right, a lot of people with eye problems amongst the Beautiful/Anonymous listeners. A lot of people with eye problems.
Caller:        Of course, yes. That, and yeah. There is such a stigma to addiction, I feel like people think that the only people that use drugs are the lower class of people, that they never have to worry about drugs touching their lives. And I will tell you that it can hit anyone. And it can happen so quickly that you won't even realize it. I promise you, I could be any one of your listener's sister, mother, aunt, daughter. I could be, my husband and I could be just anybody close to you. You would just be shocked how easy it is for drugs to find their way into any walk of life. It doesn't discriminate at all. It's not a lower class thing.
Caller:        I just want people to know that if you see something like that, if you have a family member, please don't turn your back on them. Go to a meeting with them. Just try not to be so quick to judge people who have problems.
Chris:        Right. I mean, I'm in New York City, the financial district is probably where the most cocaine is sold in this city. These are rich people.
Caller:        Oh, absolutely.
Chris:        Adderall addiction, I'm sure leading to meth. I'm sure it tumbles through that community. I want to add to something that you said, if that's okay, because I've talked about it on the show before. Drugs, and again, I'm a pretty isolated dorky guy. I'm not around drugs. I've lost one of my best friends to heroine, another old friend I lost touch with to heroine. Multiple friends who live in different states, because they fell into heroine and had to get away from their dealers and their infrastructure. Another friend, I don't know if I've talked about this on the show, once got a call in the middle of the night that he needed money, and there was this crazy elaborate story, turned out that he had fallen into drugs. It does effect all of us. Like you said, even if people don't know it. Someone in their life is in over their head with this stuff.
Chris:        You had said if you're listening, take action, go to an NA meeting. Find the resource in your area. I want to also add if you're listening, do it right now. Take the action right now. Don't just say "Oh, that's a good idea. I'll do that next week." Get on the internet right now, find the nearest meeting, and if it's starting soon go there. And if it's not, maybe go there anyway and wait until they unlock the doors. Because I think you are a very positive person in the face of a mountain of trauma, and recent trauma, and it's inspiring. And I just want to echo what you said, and also say don't put it on a to-do list. Do it right now. Pause this podcast right now, look up that meeting, and get to it. And then, you know, listen to the rest of the show in your car on the way there.
Caller:        On the way there, yes.
Chris:        Still listen to my show. I still need validation.
Caller:        I'm actually very lucky to be in a metropolitan area where there is a meeting pretty much any time of the day here. And most cities are like that. Either find an AA or a NA meeting. I found my home in NA. I found my people. They were all just as crazy as me. The first person who came up and gave me a hug when I came to a meeting is this little old lady, I won't say her name, oh, I almost did. This little old lady, I looked at her, and immediately go "There is no way this woman's a drug addict. There's no way. She looks like somebody's grandma." And then she gave me a hug, and was like "I've been there. Everything's going to be okay. Come sit down, come listen." And then as I heard her share years of addiction, and she used to be the person that would pull a shot gun on you, and rob you, and take your drugs. I'm like, it's amazing to me to hear where people have been. And how they've overcome that through going, and finding help.
Caller:        I've been through rehab, and I've been through these classes about addiction, which are great. They taught me a lot about myself. But going and sitting in a meeting and hearing someone's story who doesn't have to be there. They're there because they want to help someone else. And because being there helps them stay clean. It's the most amazing thing. And hearing how people overcome just horrible things, death and things like that, and not pick up. And that's just, no matter what, you have to get through these moments. You're going to have hard moments. Just because you get clean doesn't mean life's sunshine and roses. Obviously, I'm going to prison even though I'm clean. But it's about how you handle those moments. And you learn how to call someone, and be like "Okay. I really just want to go mess up right now." And they will take you to lunch. Or be like "Hey, why don't you read this part of the literature?" It's just an amazing support system that you always know someone's there.
Chris:        Yeah. I mean, the fact that you're 10 months clean, and you have this amount of clarity, and the ability to speak about the positives about it so much, reflects very well on that system.
Caller:        I know that I've been through some dark places in the last few years.
Chris:        Hello?
Caller:        I am so sorry. I keep hitting mute with my cheek.
Chris:        It's happened before. I hit mute with my face. I have to say, is a, that was a very popular catch phrase after an earlier episode of the show. I forget which episode it was, but I can almost guarantee, a much lighter one than this one. But hitting mute with your face is a long standing tradition here on Beautiful/Anonymous.
Caller:        My goal is, you know, I've been through some dark places, and unfortunately I've come out those, and I will never be the person I was before drugs again. I will never get that person back. She's lost. However, I am a stronger person. I have more empathy. And my goal is just to change someone else's life. To help someone else through that dark part to find the light. Because it is there. I promise you. You can find it.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah. It's super inspiring. It's funny, I just attended a thing, a talk with someone who was talking about the prison system. And they said one of the really distressing things is that prisons are so far away that people's families, it's not viable time wise, or financially, to visit them. You said your prison's an 11 hour drive away from where you live. Do you feel like it's going to cut you off? Do you think your parents and your kids are going to be able to come see you?
Caller:        Probably not. I probably won't have any visitors the four years I'm there. They do have video visiting where women can get on the computer. They have to be an approved contact. They can get on the computer if they have a microphone and a camera, and download some software and you can do a 30 minute video visit, but that's basically I'll have access to kind of a Skype situation to visit. But I won't actually have any physical visitors while I'm there. It's just not, my family just won't be able to make that trip.
Chris:        Yeah. I mean, that's a very positive development, though, I would imagine, those video visits. I didn't know that existed. That might keep you a little more sane, right?
Caller:        Right. There's all kinds of groups, there's mental health access. Some people, the only time they have any access to health care is when they go to prison, unfortunately. There's a lot of things, as long as I, the biggest thing I'm worried about is the depression. I've always battled with some depression and anxiety. I'll tell you, the last two weeks my anxiety has been through the roof. But I think that's going to be my biggest struggle, is trying to not focus on what's going on out here. I can't live out here for the next four years. I have to live in the moment, in the place where I am. I can't dwell on the negatives, or else I'll just spiral, and just lay in my bed, and not get up for the next three years. Very easily.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we have a little over a minute left, and I just want to take a moment of that to just say, first of all, a huge thank you for sharing this story. I think it could really help a lot of people. It's inspiring. And you know, hearing you just say that last part, too, I sounds like you do have a game plan. And I'm sure the reality is going to change that plan a million times, but I am really sending you my love, and my best wishes. And please pass that on to your husband as well. I hope you stay clean. I hope you keep your head on straight. And I hope you continue to try to pass on coming out on the other side to other people as well. It's really beautiful.
Caller:        Absolutely. Thank you. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm sorry I didn't say that at the beginning. Super excited to have gotten to talk to you, and to share some of my story. And maybe in three and a half years, on the other side of this, I'll make another voice mail and give you an update.
Chris:        Yeah. Please. We should check in. We should check in. I really, I have a vision in my head of you coming out on the other side of this happier, and staying clean forever, and I really hope that becomes the reality.
Caller:        I do, too. That's my goal. And I'm not going to let anything catch me, I'm not going to let anything just throw me off. I want to have a better life. And I want to make other lives better.
Chris:        Caller, I want to just really reiterate, sending so much hope to you, and your husband. So much genuine hope that you get through this experience safe, and keep learning about yourself, and most importantly, just stay clean. Really, really sending that your way. Thank you for calling.

Chris:        Next time on Beautiful/Anonymous, somebody from my grandfather's county calls up, and I get to be an excited little dork about it.
Chris:        The sense I get is that Irish people and northern Irish people are really fucking tired of Irish Americans claiming they're Irish in any way. True or false?
Speaker 4:        I don't want to say that to an Irish America.
Chris:        No, I'm Irish. I got my citizenship baby, I'm Irish now. Do a lot of Irish people go bind rolling their eyes at Irish Americans?
Speaker 4:        It's nice because they come and they buy stuff here, and there's a lot of tourist-y shops that they like to spend money here, which is nice. But yeah, you guys aren't, I don't know, it's like they're more into being Irish than we are.
Chris:        That's next time on Beautiful/Anonymous.
