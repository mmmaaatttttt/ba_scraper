Chris:        Hello?
Caller:        Yeah hello?
Chris:        Hi.
Caller:        Yeah, is this you?
Chris:        Yeah, hi.
Caller:        Hi, how are you doing man?
Chris:        How am I doing? Lets see... doing better. I had a very long week, very good week, but I'm feeling pretty good today. I'm a little... for a guy who's supposed to be taking it easy all of a sudden this time of year, I'm running around.... I got a little sick on Monday and then I went and did a-
Caller:        Oh that's not good.
Chris:        ... yeah and then I flew to California and I gave a talk to some guys from the Navy, so I was traveling a lot.
Caller:        A talk to guys in the Navy. How was that?
Chris:        It was interesting. It was a little out of my depth. I want to say hello to everybody from the Argonauts, the Argonauts squadron on the USS Nimitz. Yeah... the military... there's a lot of issues with depression and suicide in the military so they screened my HBO special and then I talked with a bunch of the ladies-
Caller:        Oh wow. That's interesting.
Chris:        Yeah very intense. Very intense and hard to do, but I was proud to do it. Yeah you would think... you would think as [crosstalk 00:04:55] a liberal artist that I'm supposed to be the... me and the military, that the values don't match, but what happens is you go meet people in person and you realize a lot of these people are just young kids trying to help. Trying to help the world.
Caller:        Yeah I agree with that. It's very interesting. I have friends in the military and some have changed completely, you know like their personality kind of gets erased sometimes and some they just come out the same.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        It really pushes them... their personalities and boundaries and it's pretty crazy.
Chris:        Yeah. I like meeting individuals from all walks of life, as anybody listens to this podcast knows, and you look somebody in the eye and they're like a 22 year old, whose like, yeah no I wanted to help... help people, help my community, help my country. It's always nice to see and you know, it's always important to remember that actual individuals trying to help us and protect us, are not the ones setting policies that we may or may not like.
Chris:        So, it was interesting, and it was flattering to be out there, but it was also in Fresno, not the easiest place to get to from New York City. I'm very-
Caller:        Definitely not.
Chris:        ... travel nightmare, blah, blah, blah.
Caller:        I really want to say-
Chris:        Yeah, yeah.
Caller:        ... before we get started, thank you for your show, I appreciate it.
Chris:        Thank you.
Caller:        It really helps me on my drives around town.
Chris:        That's awesome.
Caller:        At the moment... just to set... just to set the setting, I'm looking at around 20 ducklings just swimming around the lake.
Chris:        Ducklings. I can see it in my mind. Ducklings.
Caller:        Yeah there's three momma ducks and about 20 of them. They're just hatched.
Chris:        So many ducklings. I do feel bad that I just shouted that I can see it in my mind, when we recently had a caller who could not see things in her mind.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        Apologies to that caller.
Caller:        I know that call... really... as an artist, that call. I felt with her. If I didn't have that, I would not be in the line of work that I do for a living... and it's like, it's crazy.
Chris:        You're an artist. That's cool. Visual artist?
Caller:        I'm a 3D artist.
Chris:        3D artist.
Caller:        You know what's funny... I was actually thinking about if I ever get on the show, and tell you about a line of work a lot of people aren't aware of, and it's... I'm like the puppet master, right? So, when it comes to creating 3D characters... yeah, the puppet master. When it comes to create 3D characters, like Woody from Toy Story... I'm the guy that comes in and they hand me the model, right so, they hand me Woody, and I go ahead and I create the mechanics that go inside of them to then be handed off to an animator.
Caller:        A better way of saying it is, its like if you have an old Toyota, and you just have the body. You hand that to the mechanic and he creates a transmission, the engine, and then you hand it to the other guy and he drives it. I'm the guy in the middle. I'm the mechanic for 3D characters.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        You know, it's a really interesting job-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... and a lot of it has to do with knowing the body, knowing how things should work, and then sometimes you get handed some characters that you're like, wait a second. How am I supposed to make this thing work? You know?
Chris:        I like that you... you initially said like I'm a puppet master, and I took that to mean... you know, like puppet master as a phrase, where I'm like oh that's like a sinister... like your working behind the scenes... oh no you're like an actual master of puppets.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Of puppets... you work with puppets.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You master the puppets. You're a puppet master.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah you're a puppet master. There's nothing sinister about it.
Caller:        It's a fun job you know, and it's extremely rewarding.
Chris:        That sounds cool, so you say your like a mechanic for... so for puppets. Does this mean the sort of thing like... before the animators get to work, are you looking at things like, let's make sure the finger joints on this model look in some ways like actual finger joints that will-
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Chris:        ... and knees and rib placement. You're looking at actual things like this, like the actual functionality?
Caller:        Well... yeah. So, first thing I do is, they had me a model, and I got to look at the typology, and what that is, is... I mean no one gets confused because you'll see a textured rendered character that looks beautiful. But, what I do is I look at the actual typology within the character, which is like the lines that make up that model... because if those flow correctly, then to be honest with you, you won't get a well performing character.
Caller:        The fingers won't curl correctly, like it won't have the folds, and so, a lot of my job starts with talking with the modelers themselves and making sure that they get some good edge flow going which is the technical terms.
Caller:        I don't want to throw to much jargon out there-
Chris:        I can handle some-
Caller:        ... especially... okay, okay. Especially with my girlfriend I realize that I'll talk to her about things and she'll just like... it's go over her head and I'm like, I'm sorry. Sometimes it's normal for me to say things, regularly.
Chris:        Yeah. So you-
Caller:        But yeah.
Chris:        ... so this is specifically with animated characters? This is not... this is not like your Andy Serkis, your Jar Jar Binks... like a human, where they do the ping pong ball motion capture type thing? This is different than MOCAP?
Caller:        No actually... to be honest... I did meet him rather recently.
Chris:        Jar Jar Binks?
Caller:        Andy Serkis.
Chris:        Andy Serkis.
Caller:        No, Andy Serkis.
Chris:        Got it, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Caller:        I wish I met Jar Jar Binks.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        But-
Chris:        Me too.
Caller:        ... so Andy Serkis' job... and there's a lot of... there's a lot of conflict between what people say and what he says, because I don't know if you're aware of this, but he's come out and said that animators don't do... like they don't do anything. He does most of the work. I had this conversation with him, and I asked his opinion on it because it's kind of like a sore spot in the industry.
Chris:        Who knew.
Caller:        I happened to agree with Andy-
Chris:        You do?
Caller:        Huh?
Chris:        I was just going to say on the outside, none of us knew that Andy Serkis was at the center of such controversy amongst animators.
Caller:        Yeah it's a controversy because... to put out a character... you know like Woody from Toy Story and I'll come back to that because it's the easiest reference that most people get, he was animated by a lot of people. It wasn't just one of them. Right? So, when it comes to Gollum... Gollum was acted out with one individual, and a lot of animators came and tweaked that to make it... to make the final piece. Right? Because, they have to extend certain things, because the characters didn't completely match Andy.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        And so, he said a few times that... or something along the lines... I don't want to be quoted on the fact that he said this and that, he did mention how he does most of the job and the animators shouldn't get the credit for a lot of things. Something along those lines. Maybe not exactly that.
Caller:        He's right to a certain extent, because an animators job is to get the feel of the character and the soul of character out of the puppet, you know, that I create, and then... just make the audience believe in this person. I happen to agree with Andy in the sense that he does a great job in actually getting these characters to feel and just getting the personality out there. The animators come and they do... they have to tweak a lot of things, because for some reason, I think... he did the Planet of the Apes characters as well-
Chris:        Those are my favorite movies.
Caller:        ... but it doesn't look like it. Yeah. Amazing movies.
Chris:        The new [crosstalk 00:13:17].
Caller:        Go ahead.
Chris:        I was just going to say those new Planet of the Apes, that trilogy might be the high point of cinema to me. Those are my favorite... those are the best movies man. Apes ride horses and shit. The best... anyway... I see what you're saying, so he already provides the soul, he provides the emotional core, which in a MOCAP sense gives them that. Whereas animators who are doing non-MOCAP animation, like you mentioned, they have to... they have to build that and account for that from the ground up.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah.
Chris:        It's intense.
Caller:        So, yeah... it's truly interesting to see... I see a lot of points in the industry that... you know, there's a lot of insights that the common person who goes to the cinema and watches films, or plays video games, they don't see a lot of these things and it's a really interesting point of view.
Chris:        Yeah I have a question that I've always had and I feel like you might the actual person who can answer it. This is a question I've had for like 15 years. Maybe a little less than that.
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        I feel like you are uniquely poised to answer.
Caller:        Okay I don't want too much pressure.
Chris:        No.
Caller:        Go ahead, I'll try my best.
Chris:        The worst that happens is you're like yeah I don't know. I'm not the person to ask and I'm like oh, I shouldn't hype that up so much, my bad. Don't worry about it.
Chris:        I feel like you'll actually have a lot of insight on this. I remember... I feel like one of the first... like for me... I remember going to see Shrek. I remember that being something that's a kid [inaudible 00:14:54], and I remember seeing when animation took this turn... I remember always feeling like the one thing they haven't nailed is like... eyes. Is the human eyes that feels like they have emotion.
Chris:        I remember specifically watching Shrek 2, and being like it's so creepy because the eyes just aren't quite right. The eyes can't quite... and now they've nailed that. Now, Pixar in particular, it's like... and I feel like the human brain wants to recognize human eyes, all the time, right? Like, that's just the instinct is the like, latch onto another humans eyes. Now they got that right.
Chris:        What has developed in animation eye technology over the past handful of years that has made that shift so profound? Your turn.
Caller:        So yeah that is part of my job.
Chris:        Damn! You're the guy that fixed the eyes!
Caller:        I'll tell you something, there's a phrase... and you can look it up later, it's called the uncanny valley. Have you heard of the uncanny valley?
Chris:        I've heard this phrase. I do not know anything about it. I will say, Harry in the booth just put "uncanny valley" roughly 30 seconds ago, which is an amazing, amazing... he just wrote that on my computer screen.
Caller:        The uncanny valley is essentially where digital concept that you're looking at, gets creepy. Where you go too realistic with an aspect or the whole thing, and it just gets really creepy, because our brain can decipher what's cartoony and we can accept that. It can decipher what's real because we see that every day, and we can accept that.
Caller:        But, there's an in between, right? It's kind of like a cliff. That's why they call it the uncanny valley. Its like you just dropped off the cliff and I just doesn't feel right... at all.
Chris:        Really?
Caller:        So-
Chris:        You guys can... and whatever you can make is actually making it feel too real?
Caller:        Yes. Making it feel just... almost real enough.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Because our eyes will be able to tell you as a viewer, this doesn't look right. There's something off about this, and it gives you that sense of... weirdness.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        So, in... over time as programs that we use as artists, evolve... and not only that, but techniques evolve... we've been able to create better systems for just eye controls. When it comes to creating a character, that is part of the job, is to stick a joint in the eye, and just get it to move around.
Caller:        Not only that, now you've got to get the eyelids to look right, you've got to get the eyebrows to look right, because you might be looking at the eyes because that's where... it's like the phrase goes, "you can tell the soul of a person through their eyes", or something, I'm not sure if that's how it goes, or something like that.
Chris:        Yeah. Eyes are the window to the soul.
Caller:        There you go.
Chris:        Yeah. Teamed up.
Caller:        We have... we look at a lot of data. Especially with Snapchat and all of these companies coming out with all these AR stuff, we look at all the videos and really look at the minor details, and have come up with systems that can easily recreate those.
Caller:        When it comes to doing films like, Life of Pi, or Avatar, or even Planet of the Apes-
Chris:        Yes. The best.
Caller:        ... the artists know what they're doing. They know what they're doing because they're really digging in and doing their research and just... its hard because... working extremely long hours, just to get this one part right. That if you don't get it right, it really throws off everyone else's work, you know?
Chris:        Right. Right.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I've been thinking about this, even thinking about Pixar, I can see in my head... and again I feel so bad... what a bad episode... just so everybody knows, you and I are taping this. I think the week after... that's the most recent episode we released, so I keep saying I can see what you're saying in my head... you and I are taping it when it literally just came out, the caller who can't see any of this.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Apologize.
Caller:        I did hear that one, so...
Chris:        Yeah. You must have had a weird reaction to that one. Thinking Pixar, I can see... I shut my eyes I see Toy Story, I remember Woody blinking his eyes and it's a toy. It doesn't look so real. You compare that with like Coco, which I just watched, and it's like night and day. The way the technology has progressed even since then, those eyes on those characters are just... they're able to get somewhere different that they weren't able to get 10 years ago. Huh?
Caller:        Yeah, yeah. 100%. Even for me, you know, the first movie that blew my mind and made me want to do what I do, I saw when I was a kid... it was Dinosaurs. I don't know if you remember that one.
Chris:        Dinosaurs.
Caller:        Essentially there was a meteorite that struck and then all of these dinosaurs had to move around-
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        It was really weird. It wasn't completely realistic, but it was really close. That movie really inspired me. One of the things that captivated me about it, was the eyes. To me as a kid... as an adult, I saw a movie recently and I was like, wow this is really outdated, but as a child... it was real. I was looking in the window right back to the Jurassic era.
Caller:        It's really interesting.
Chris:        Yeah, since we got into it, this uncanny valley concept, this idea that you can not... you can make it not realistic enough, you can make it too realistic... there's a sweet spot in which an audience will feel comfortable sitting and watching it.
Chris:        Are there any examples... I feel like, maybe all of us have in mind, those... like I can point to things and be like that one didn't feel realistic... are there any famous examples of projects where people got too realistic and passed that tipping point? Creeped out their audiences where it felt a little too real?
Caller:        Yes, but off the top of my head, I can't tell you, and I don't want to just pull a movie out and stick it right under that umbrella. I don't want to say anything without being certain, but yes I've seen a few that have really struck me in a weird way-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... like I just... I've got to stop.
Chris:        Unsettling. Maybe we can Google that. Maybe if you wouldn't mind Harry, Googling like uncanny valley who's taking it too far. Maybe we'll get some examples so you're not the one throwing them under the bus, but we can still get your professional opinion.
Chris:        We'll look some up.
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        What type of stuff... so, do you work on big budget stuff, are you working on smaller scale things? Where are you at in your career?
Caller:        I'm in a startup company.
Chris:        You are?
Caller:        I can't say much because it's a very secretive company.
Chris:        Ooh.
Caller:        I'm working a lot into... into experiences on stuff that would be on game engines and stuff.
Chris:        Mm-hmm (affirmative)-
Caller:        I've signed way too many papers and I can't say a lot of things, to be honest.
Chris:        No, that's totally fair. I will say, gaming seems to be a thing, especially for... because gamers, there's a whole culture of gaming. People don't realize, so much technology these days develops out of gaming, and then makes its way to other entertainment areas, and-
Caller:        It's the future.
Chris:        The future. People also don't realize, there's been years I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, where some of the biggest earning monetarily entertainment platforms of the year, are actually games not movies. Right? Games have started to match movies as far as the actual amount of money they generate.
Caller:        Yep, that's correct, and that and it's being backed up even by a slow rising trend, which is Eastward. There's a huge... I mean, I don't have time to play games anymore, it's tragic because I quite literally make them, but esports-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... it's becoming like a whole new football. It's also because of the coaches and the kids growing up today and what to them is good looking and what they want to do.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        They stay indoors more and so they play video games. They stream people playing video games on Twitch, which is our version of going over to your friends house and watching them play Super Nintendo.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        Which I know you didn't play much games growing up, but-
Chris:        Growing up I did.
Caller:        Okay, okay, okay.
Chris:        I had... you'll appreciate this story because I think you'll know... this pinpoints my age perfectly, it pinpoints exactly my culture and as someone whose immersed in gaming. I actually grew up playing a lot of games. I was a Nintendo kid, I got Nintendo when was in third grade. I had to quit gaming... I started to realize I had a very addictive personality in college. It was after GoldenEye, which tells you everything you need to know, but GoldenEye-
Caller:        Oh wow. Yeah.
Chris:        I was so addicted to GoldenEye, that I started all my dreams... I swear to God, I would only have dreams where I was running down hallways. Every dream I had, was just me running down a hallway, and it's because I was playing so much GoldenEye, that it was... I realized man, this is taking over my actual brain. It's readjusting my brain chemistry where I'm only dreaming in one certain way, and it's just me running down hallways.
Chris:        Had to quit if I was going to focus on anything else in life.
Caller:        Oh my God that's... that's...
Chris:        That was a pretty seminal game, right? That's like a turning point game for N64 I think.
Caller:        It was.
Chris:        Cultural touchstone of the game.
Caller:        The FPS genre which is the First Person Shooter-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... that is a big... a big glory moment in that line.
Chris:        Yeah I mean, you know. You've got your Wolfenstein, you got your Doom, you got your Duke Nukem, and then I would say GoldenEye is the next big leap in FPS, right? I don't know the history of this as well as some others, but those are some that come to mind from my childhood, and that's when I said, I'm out.
Caller:        Yeah. Along the lines right there.
Chris:        We just looked it up, apparently one of the most famous uncanny valley moments is... and I'm looking at a picture of this that Harry just put on my screen, truly disconcerting... apparently in Twilight, in Twilight the final... in the final movie of the Twilight series, there was an animatronic baby and... it was supposed to be very intelligent, but the eyes make it look completely horrifying.
Chris:        Just actually horrifying.
Caller:        There you go.
Chris:        Yeah, they took it too far.
Caller:        Don't have bad dreams about that one now.
Chris:        Ooh.
Caller:        That can usually happen with those.
Chris:        Ooh. Okay so you're working in gaming, your helping to enact this technology, helping to develop-
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        How does one get into... you got to go to school for this?
Caller:        I did, and look I'll tell you this right now, I went to my community college, at the same time, I was going to high school, so I got my associates before my high school diploma.
Chris:        Good for you. I've never heard of that.
Caller:        Yeah. There's a program called dual enrollment, so I did that from ninth grade through twelfth.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        By my senior year of high school, all I was doing was taking like wood shop, auto shop and machine shop courses.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        They called me the shop kid, because I took all my credits through college, and those applied back into my high school as well.
Chris:        No wait, let me ask you... because I would have to imagine, so your studying this at a college level, you're heading for an associates degree, this is the stuff where you need to know woodworking, metal working... you're going to be working with models, your going to be working with puppets, you understand this is a goal.
Chris:        I know from my high school experience, that shop kids were not necessarily the motivated ones who were getting ahead academically.
Caller:        They were the worst.
Chris:        The shop kids-
Caller:        That don't do anything.
Chris:        The phrase shop kid was used for the kid who would like, burn you with a cigarette while you were waiting for the bus. That was the shop kids.
Caller:        I have a weird laugh so if you hear a squeak, that's my laugh.
Chris:        It did sound... I wasn't certain what was happening. It makes me want to make you laugh for the entirety of the rest of this phone call.
Chris:        That's your laugh? STOP! Stop!
Chris:        We're not talking about animation anymore. What...
Caller:        Go on Chris.
Chris:        That's your laugh! That's your real laugh?
Caller:        Oh that's funny. Yeah.
Chris:        This can't be.
Caller:        It's a curse and a gift.
Chris:        How did... has that been your...
Chris:        (screaming in the background).
Caller:        Oh please.
Chris:        Wait!
Caller:        I'll tell myself not to laugh.
Chris:        Has that been your laugh your whole life?
Caller:        Yeah. Actually honestly, it started after puberty. It was the weirdest thing.
Chris:        Do other people in your family have this laugh?
Caller:        My son he is a year old, he laughs and he squeaks, and I don't know if its just because he's a baby, or if that's his laugh. I'm not quite sure.
Chris:        I wonder if he's mimicking you. So when you started laughing like that... people got enough problems in puberty with like all of a sudden there's weird patches of hair and their bodies are growing out of control, and you also developed like a... laugh that sounds like a goose. Like a goose.
Caller:        A goose. Yeah. Yeah. I actually, my best friend he loves my laugh, and he'll defend my laugh in public places.
Chris:        I love your laugh.
Caller:        I've been at comedy shows where I... they purposely... like my friends want to sit me in the front so I can laugh, and then see the reaction of the comedian. I'm like please don't.
Chris:        Well here's the thing I was saying. Someone with your laugh, I would have to imagine as a comedian, the way they react to that... and they have to address it, a lot of the time, I bet. The way they do that, I would argue, can immediately tell you their actual skill as a comedian, see the people who aren't confident enough yet, are going to make fun of you for it, and there's going to be other people who realize it's such a gift. I bet you've had that experience where some comedians embrace it and make it a positive. That speaks to their skill, because... I'll say this, I have a pretty obnoxious laugh, you've heard it on the podcast.
Chris:        I had a friend-
Caller:        It's not bad. It's good.
Chris:        ... it goes big though... it goes big fast. Why can ever... you can't make fun of someone for how they laugh. I'll bet you out there in the world, if you're listening to this, you don't laugh. Laughter is an expression of joy and laughter... comedy and horror are the two genres where you don't get to pick if and when you react.
Chris:        You don't get to choose when you laugh. Everybody knows a forced laugh when they hear one. Everyone knows a genuine laugh. It's a beautiful thing to express your joy, it's why I'm addicted to doing what I do. I'll never make fun of you for your laugh.
Chris:        That being said, I will laugh in response to your laugh. I will laugh very hard when I hear your laugh.
Caller:        You'll laugh with me.
Chris:        I will laugh with you, but I will never judge it, because laughter is an expression of joy, that's like killing a mockingbird. You can't ever judge someone for how they laugh. People got weird laughs, that's joy. Never judge that. You never make someone feel embarrassed or ashamed for experiencing joy. Can't do that.
Caller:        I'll tell you what... and this is a short theory of mine, because I do have a weird laugh and so the thought of what is laughing has occurred to me, at certain times in my life, and I've come to a conclusion and I may be completely wrong, but it's my opinion.
Caller:        Laughter is a mating call. To other species you're a human-
Chris:        It's an aphrodisiac.
Caller:        ... do you as a person want to be around people who make you laugh? Or do you as a person want to be around people who make you cry? Or just make you have bad feelings.
Chris:        I mean I'm hoping to be around people who make me do both, baby.
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        That's just a theory I had.
Chris:        No I think it's true. I think people are attracted to laughter. Attracted to those who make them laugh.
Chris:        I will say with that laugh, maybe that's why there's 20 fucking ducklings around at all times.
Caller:        You have jokes.
Chris:        I mean if you start a call by telling me your surrounded by 20 ducklings, and it turns out this is your laugh... I have to point out that maybe you're surrounded by ducklings more often than the average person on the street.
Caller:        I have had birds come around me because of my laugh.
Chris:        No!
Caller:        Not ducklings.
Chris:        No.
Caller:        Yes, yes.
Chris:        Your laugh attracts birds.
Caller:        I've been with friends that my laugh has attracted birds and then they just break out laughing themselves.
Chris:        Your laugh somehow tunes into the language and frequency of certain birds where they think that it's either like a mating call, or a distress signal. You can communicate with birds via your laugh?
Caller:        Apparently. I don't do it purposely... like Spiderman. I don't use my power to like capture birds because I don't want to.
Chris:        I mean yeah, with great power comes great responsibility.
Caller:        Great responsibility.
Chris:        Hell yeah dude.
Caller:        There you go.
Chris:        Hell yeah dude. That is... I have never... I have 17 years where my profession is basically try to produce the sound of laughter from other human beings. You have by far, the most unique laugh I've ever heard.
Caller:        I highly appreciate that. I'll be sure to tell my best friend about it. I'm pretty sure he'll enjoy that compliment.
Chris:        Yeah. Just you walking around laughing, getting followed by ducklings. That's pretty great.
Caller:        I'm actually at my workplace. When I started working here, and I laughed for the first time, they started a tally on the board, of who can make me laugh the most. So like, a competition of just... you know it was my first job out of school, and so I was like this works I guess.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        It was entertaining. I didn't mind it because they were trying to make me laugh all day. It's like being a stand-up show all day long.
Chris:        That's awesome. That's good that you can just own it.
Chris:        We have looked up other uncanny valley moments, apparently... I mean, there's been a lot. People talk about this a lot. Apparently Beowulf, Polar Express, and Final Fantasy the Spirits Within.
Caller:        Oh, Polar Express.
Chris:        Really, that's an... and then apparently in Shrek, the producers had to go back and dial down the realism of the character Fiona, because the skin was so realistic the animators felt like they were animating a corpse. It didn't feel right.
Caller:        Oh wow.


Chris:        So Polar Express that's one that you were like, oh yeah.
Caller:        Actually, and I want to make this note, because I do know people who have worked on Polar Express... and my laughter, you know people know who I am when they hear the laughs-
Chris:        Yeah. You just outed yourself hard.
Caller:        ... so... I did, I did. But the reason why that movie was... has the uncanny valley feel, is because it was rushed out.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        I just want to make that one out there. It's still a great film and to do this day, it's played every Christmas.
Chris:        Yeah, and also lets be clear, you're being really cool about it and for anybody who is listening and who may know you now, I'm not asking you to talk shit about this. It's just a very fascinating concept that you brought up, and everyone who works in your field it sounds like, has to focus on this merging of these theories and this technology and everyone is trying to figure this out and wrap their head around it.
Chris:        I'm not asking you to try to talk shit about your peers, I'm just trying to say-
Caller:        Okay, okay.
Chris:        ... was a cool and fascinating thing. When you do a very cursory Google search, here's what comes up when people talk about this. I'm not trying to put you on the spot and say condemn or defend your peers, I'm saying oh that thing we've been talking about, oh yeah here's some examples. That's on me, that's not on you.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So, were you an art kid... were you always the kid that could draw like crazy?
Caller:        Oh absolutely not.
Chris:        Really?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So how do you get into animation?
Caller:        I like drawing.
Chris:        How do you get so motivated to do this that you take college classes during high school?
Caller:        That's the thing... back to the school. When I was in college courses, I had to pick a career. I was in a very down time in my life where I was couch surfing and just like sleeping in my car all this crap-
Chris:        In high school?
Caller:        Yeah man. Let's not get into that. That just gets bad, but you just gotta come out punching. I go ahead and I'm like animation. I love films. They are what makes me happy and so some of my happiest moments were watching these with my dad.
Caller:        Let's go ahead and try this, and so I tried it out and I realized that drawing is pretty good, because to know animation you got to know the principal of animation and you have to know how to draw to a certain extent. When you're working with 3D characters it's more about moving a puppet around in time and space, and getting the certain actions out that you can do with video reference.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        A lot of the films that are made now-a-days, I'm pretty sure all of them have video reference that the animators looked at to go ahead and make these films.
Caller:        I said I'm going to try animation. I graduated high school, I had my associates, and I went to my university town where I'm at, and it was fun... but their art program wasn't equivalent... sorry Sally, and sorry to your arm... it [inaudible 00:37:29] you shit in the corner, you break a glass with mace on it, and then he put a sign next to it, and that's art. Very contemporary.
Caller:        There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not my type of art.
Chris:        Yeah. With shit on the ground.
Caller:        I went too... yeah. I applied to SCAD, which is an art school in Savannah.
Chris:        Uh-huh (affirmative). Pretty well known art school.
Caller:        You were just in Savannah, correct?
Chris:        I was yeah, I was there for two days. Beautiful town.
Caller:        You might have seen the word SCAD-
Chris:        Oh yeah.
Caller:        ... in a lot of places because they essentially own that city.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        That's where I was at.
Chris:        You went to SCAD?
Caller:        Yeah I went to SCAD, and it was great. It was extremely expensive, but the guidance was amazing.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        I say guidance, because they teach you how to teach yourself.
Chris:        That's cool.
Caller:        I did that, and I graduated, and I got a job... and I've got a little son. He's cute, baby has my laugh.
Chris:        How old are you?
Caller:        I'm 26.
Chris:        26. Wow. I tell you, I'm not going to ask, you don't want to go into it, but just connecting the dots... the idea that you were sleeping in a car in high school, you showed this type of motivation... you went and go an associates degree while you were in school, SCAD is no joke. That's one of the top art schools in the country, even I know that. The fact that your now working in the field that you choose, you're raising a kid at a young age... I got to say, you don't have to tell me anything about it. I'm not going to bother you about it, but just connecting those dots... holy shit you really toughed it out. You really held it together, huh?
Caller:        It's interesting, look my... the way I see the world is a lot different than others. It's like I wasn't handed a great deck of cards... and I'll go into it a little bit, just because I don't mind. I've told the story a million times when people ask.
Caller:        My dad went to jail for some cocaine stuff in Miami, the year I was born... if not, a few months into me being born. He was in jail for five years.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        In that time, my mom quite literally sold everything and left the whole situation. She kind of left it so everything was safe for us. That become... you know it was like, all right, so are we just going to have to be moving everywhere, and this is our life... and that was completely okay.
Caller:        Over time, as I was growing up, my mom was extremely hard on me in school. To this day, I thank her. It was tough, but she did instill a lot of good in me, but at the same time, in doing so, she created a lot of hate in me towards her. Because of how she came on to doing these things. It was what it is. The only thing I could never forgive her... so she has a girlfriend and she's had a girlfriend... she had two when I was growing up, and then she stayed with one and she's been with her for about 12 years. To me that was completely normal.
Caller:        She's always this feeling of guilt that she wasn't with a man or anything. I'm like, it's okay. She's like no you don't want to be around me because of... and I'm like, no that's not the reason. It's because you're crazy. It just comes to the point where we're estranged. Its that relationship.
Chris:        That's sad.
Caller:        She hasn't met my son.
Chris:        Ah that's sad.
Caller:        It is what it is, you know?
Chris:        I'm sorry about that.
Chris:        Hello?
Caller:        Hello? Yeah I can hear you.
Chris:        Oh wow that story got so emotionally intense that the phone couldn't handle it anymore. Had the phone blanked out.
Caller:        Sorry about that.
Chris:        Now sometimes you laugh and it sounds like a laugh, and then sometimes you laughs-
Caller:        Yeah because it's a chuckle.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        A chuckle.
Chris:        So when you chuckle it sounds like a laugh, and when you laugh it sounds like a novelty toy being squeezed. Like a dog toy being squeezed.
Caller:        That's essentially it.
Chris:        You know this is now just becoming a pissing contest of me trying to describe your laugh in a way that gets you to laugh, and then you're really trying hard to keep a straight face, because you don't want to give that to me.
Chris:        Now that I'm going meta and I'm explaining this contest that's brewing between us, this laugh contest, you're now laughing because... yeah it's clear that we both know I'm trying to get you to laugh and you don't want to laugh.
Chris:        I will say in my experience, the number one thing that gets a person to laugh, is telling them you're not allowed to laugh.
Caller:        I agree, because I know... people always try to make me laugh and that's kind of it right there. That's the one thing that always gets me. It works.
Chris:        I'm just saying, anyone listening right now, anyone listening right now... would be so mad if you laughed right now.
Caller:        How come?
Chris:        Because they're going to veer off the side of the road and crash their cars.
Caller:        You know what's funny, I listen to-
Chris:        Everything about your laugh.
Caller:        ... show a lot. Yes.
Caller:        I listen to your show a lot when I'm Uber-ing, because SCAD is an amazing school, but SCAD is a very expensive school.
Chris:        Yes.
Caller:        So, sometimes you make me laugh and I am driving and I'm like come on, you gotta stop this man. You gotta stop with the jokes, and here I am on the phone with you.
Caller:        Not driving.
Chris:        Oh no, oh no, oh no, no I have the giggles. Oh no. Oh no, no. No, no. No. Stop, stop. Oh no.
Caller:        With great power comes great responsibility.
Chris:        I'm going to throw up. I'm going to throw up.
Caller:        Oh, that's funny.
Chris:        Oh, God. Oh, god.
Caller:        I hope you're okay guys.
Chris:        I am I just laughed so hard... oh God. Oh God.
Caller:        I'm so sorry.
Chris:        No, it's not your fault. I asked for it. It was a Pandora's box. Oh, god. Yeah I'm just getting over a stomach virus a couple of days ago and then I laughed so hard that my... oh my God. I just found out that it's like a loop. I've got to be careful because I want to make you laugh, because I find it funny, but I find it so funny that it's actually dangerous for me.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        God... oh God.
Caller:        Hello? Yeah.
Chris:        Okay so, did you-
Caller:        So-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        I mean [inaudible 00:45:47], because this could be a laughing competition, but it's not healthy for you clearly. As a comedian I would expect that to be good, but you can't handle a laugh.
Chris:        No, here's what... because we have 19 minutes left. This one is flying by. Here's what it's going to be clearly. I'm going to just try to ask you about animation and I'm going to pray you don't laugh along the way because it's just going to be... it's just every time it's going to be a house of cards that falls down again.
Chris:        So...
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        So, did you, how did you- so that SCAD degree goes a long way. You must be able to get a job right out of school with that thing, right?
Caller:        No, absolutely not. SCAD degree doesn't go a long way.
Chris:        It doesn't?
Caller:        I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what... I wasn't even asked for my degree when I got my job.
Chris:        Oh wow.
Caller:        When you graduate... our version of a resume is a resume attached with a demo reel.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        Showing what you're capable of doing.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        Right? If you spent your years at SCAD, partying down in downtown, then let me tell you, your resume is not going to look pretty.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        Your demo reel is not going to look pretty, so no company is going to hire you.
Chris:        So there could also be a prodigy- you're in an industry still young enough to there could be something prodigy who never went to school, and if they can bring it, they can bring it and they'll get hired.
Caller:        Well, if you can bring it, you can show it.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        If you have it but don't show it, that's not going to take you anywhere.
Chris:        Right. So it's an environment where if you go and buckle down and do the work, you put your head down and do the work, learn the technology, learn how to merge it with art... SCAD's a great place that can teach you to do that and then you still have to go do it.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll tell you where I learned a lot of my stuff, is like... my upbringing was a lot of couch surfing. What I love to do deep in my heart, was great my laptop and sit down in a Starbucks at 7:00am and not leave until 12... at night.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        Right?
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        What I would do is, I had access to an online digital training library called digital tutors, which is now a tutor site.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        They were amazing because I could use my time in so many other ways, but I'm like want to do this. If I want to do this, then I've got to do my art. I would just sit down and do all these tutorials and I must've gone through most of their library for the stuff I wanted to do.
Caller:        When I got to college, SCAD particularly, I realized that a lot of the kids there got out of high school and just came here. They didn't have any of the stuff... they weren't aware of what program it was, or even how to use it, which is the main part. I was like well I kind of have an advantage.
Caller:        It was just an interesting thing, you know to see that... all the work I put in while in those shitty situations, did pay off big time, because when I was in school, I was doing well and getting stuff going. Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah, and good for you, because it's... you know, adversity can... a lot of kids who have a dad in prison, who have a mom whose maybe got... a lot of these guilt issues getting in between you, they're not going to act to that adversity by buckling down and finding a quiet place to go work and find their way out of it.
Chris:        It's really... I mean... so many things that you've said that I can connect the dots and realize like... that's a really special thing. A lot of people go get in trouble, you didn't do that. You went the other way.
Chris:        God I am so scared you were going to laugh. I'm so scared at any point I can barely talk to you.
Caller:        Oh wow, I'm holding it.
Chris:        Yeah you just barely held that one.
Caller:        I did, I did. This goes back to why I'm thankful for a lot of stuff my mom did. My dad passed away when I was 12, out of... it's not the jail... cancer.
Chris:        I'm sorry.
Caller:        My relationship buckled out with my mom at that point, but at the age of 12, I started working the local flea market, jumping... I was a 12 year old kid, I was like hey did you need someone to work for you, and they're like I'll pay you $30 a day, I'm like, okay.
Caller:        I did dollar stores, I sold furniture which is what I did for a long time, I sold kitchen stuff... and I learned, I learned how to hustle that way with that you know. I mean, I'm in South Florida, I'll just say it like that, so you get a good mix of people and Haitians were one of the biggest ones in the flea market.
Caller:        I love Haitians. They can hustle anything. I was a 12 year old kid trying to hustle with the Haitian because he wanted this at $10 when it was $30. Over time, over five years of this, it was like training. It's what it was. I mean it wasn't paying worth crap, but I learned how to talk to people and I learned how to be more open and humble about things, because I see people coming through every day and people who go to flea markets sometimes don't have much. You could see it on their faces, you could read people. Which, is also part of animating. You got to be able to... walk the walk.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        This is something I actually want you to do. I want you to picture something... even though I picture that sometimes and it was beautiful when she said it. Next time you're in public-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... next time you're in public I want you to stand behind someone who is walking and copy their walk. Copy the shoulder movement, copy any limp or slight limp they might have, the hand movement and that will get you in the mentality of that person. You're going to see a lot of things just by [inaudible 00:51:28]. I learned this... and then it came back up because one of my professors said do this check out who a cool person is and I'm like I haven't done that in a while, holy crap.
Chris:        Now that's good advice and it sounds like a cool exercise. I will remind you, I live in New York City where that may get me killed.
Caller:        Oh my I forget about that. I've never been to New York so I wouldn't know.
Chris:        Yeah if you just follow someone and mock them or mimic them, they'll take that mockery and you might get screamed at on the subway for that... you might get me killed.
Caller:        I'm sorry. Next time you're in Savannah, do it for sure. They understand.
Chris:        Yes everyone is so nice there. Everyone is so nice there.
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        Yeah, now-
Caller:        So-
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Go ahead.
Chris:        No, I was going to say so how much... you're working and you can't say in exactly what, but you've mentioned there's so much augmented reality type stuff right now, this stuff is going to change everything huh?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I feel like-
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You look at it... you're like... even like you look at the stuff Disney's rumored to be doing with their new Star Wars theme park, and you're like oh it's just going to be like Westworld, there's going to be a real Westworld where you go live on reality in a theme park. That stuff's coming huh?
Caller:        Yeah, yeah. 100%.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        It's crazy. It's a future of the world that's changing and a lot of people don't realize and it's going to be really exciting.
Chris:        Yeah. You've got these puppets.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So, how long did it take you to... how long after school until you got your gig?
Caller:        Graduated in March and I got a job like a month after.
Chris:        This year?
Caller:        I was applying while I was... yeah no... this was 2015.
Chris:        Years ago okay.
Caller:        So, it's been three years.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Three years here.
Chris:        That's cool.
Caller:        It's great.
Chris:        That's cool.
Caller:        It's like that VR realm kind of stuff and it's pretty awesome.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah.
Chris:        That stuff's cool. That stuff's cool. I like that-
Caller:        Yeah man.
Chris:        ... it's funny, so many of the early calls to this podcast, and I think this podcast still gets unfairly stereotyped, because a lot of it early on was struggling artists looking to find... I think a lot of that is because that's how people who knew me before this podcast, that's one of the major things they related to me on. You're the guy who found public access and built a career off of it, you know, when your career was failing.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        It's really nice to talk to you, a couple years into doing the podcast, because I think it's such a reminder... I bet you'd agree with me. The advice I always give every artist, you can sit and wonder why it's not working out, as much as you want, you can sit around and say I've got all the skills in the world, if you're not a hustler and you're not resilient, and you can't figure out how to have a thick skin... don't be an artist.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You got all those things.
Caller:        I do. I'll tell you what, someone recently told me... I pay a month $1,300 in student loans, right that's ridiculous.
Chris:        Wait, $1,300 for what?
Caller:        My student loans.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        That's a month.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        That's my monthly payment, with Miss Sallie Mae, auntie Sallie. What I've gotta do is... I was told the other day, they're like the definition of a hustler, and I'm like why do you say that, and they're like, because you have so many jobs.
Caller:        I do Uber, I do some gigs at CVS where I do surveys for people. I have my main job which provides me with my healthcare and everything for my child and my family and my main source of income, but... and I also make pens, so... it's like-
Chris:        You make pens?
Caller:        ... those things just to make up for the burden of my student loan. It's crazy. It's nuts.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        You know? I have a good paying job, but there's a lot of my friends, most of them they graduated and don't have a job. I don't know how the crap they're making it.
Chris:        Yeah it's scary to me. There's a flawed system where we... we shrink social services and then also ask kids to start their adult lives, $100,000 in debt. That's just very scary.
Caller:        I'll tell you what... the future of education and I'm 100% with this, is going to be online. It's going to be online training, and it's going to be about skill sets.
Chris:        It is.
Caller:        A lot of kids are getting taught that it's not about that, it's about degree... and unless you want to be a... excuse me... unless you want to be a doctor or lawyer or something that does require a degree, then dial. I don't think you got to go to school. Just apply yourself. There's enough online training to do most of it.
Chris:        You're going to get me in trouble with my mom, because I've gone on record, don't go to college, it's dumb. I shouldn't say that... but I should say, if you're direction-less, and you're not sure at all what you want to do, like I was... take a gap year until you figure it out.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Don't spend that money just to spend that money. We don't live in that age, like you said, I'm like you. You've found these things that became your real school that you knew then you went to school with some intent and purpose to follow it... same thing. I found the UCB Theater. That was my real college... comedy. My comedy college. I should've done that.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Not everybody should do comedy college. I don't want every asshole who signs up for an Improv class to blame me. I don't want that. Sorry I just got... but, if you realize you want to do that, you're right. I think specialized focus training is the way of the future.
Chris:        I think a lot of middle class privileged people used to... the DeVry commercials would come on TV right, you'd see the TV trade school commercials... you'd be like hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Those infomercials for school. Its like no I think that's the way of the future. I think small specialized programs that focus on real applicable skills, that don't cost you six figures, that's the future. I think you're right.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. UGAMI is beautiful. They'll say it's a hundred dollars for a course, put it on your wishlist, in a week they'll find you $10 discounts. I worked for UGAMI so this is not any commercial for them, but I use them to then sit down and learn new things so I'm more valuable to the company that I work for.
Caller:        I wish that was voiced to the coming age of kids that are growing up.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Because, they're still trying to find the idea of Harvard, and Harvard's great... but if don't want to be anything that requires that, then don't do it. It's a road that you can see, but it's not one that you have to take.
Chris:        I also feel there's this thing of like you can be whatever you want to be... and I think there's some truth to that, but it's also a dangerous thing to say to a young person. I think the second half of it should be, you can be whatever you want to be, but the first thing you need to do to get that, isn't to go to that... it's to start putting tools in your toolbox. You got to build those tools first.
Chris:        By all means, chase the dream, but you better have... if you're going to chase it, when you get that chance, you better know exactly... you better have your knives sharp when you get there. You know what I mean? You better have done thousands of reps on all the tools you'll need to be successful so when that lucky moment does present itself, you're not still a dreamer. You're a worker.
Caller:        Yep. I agree.
Chris:        Look at that, we got all serious. I thought this stuff was all going to be about trying to make you laugh, and hear that honk noise again, that honk laugh. Instead we got real serious.
Caller:        It'll come. It is a thing that's very important and I believe... the internet is changing. It'll become something that will be voiced more and more when professionals who are graduating now or have graduated recently, will start voicing their concerns.
Chris:        I think so.
Caller:        They're the ones who are having kids and they are going to see the system they were put into was flawed. I'll tell you what... if my son wants to be a doctor, I'll pay for your school. If you want to be an artist, let's talk about what you want to paint with. Let's go to Blick, let's go buy some stuff.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        It's as simple as that.
Chris:        Step one, and then I'm sure too, if it's... and there's real potential shown, and it seems like even more important than potential... dedication shown, all right now what school do you think gives you the best show and let's talk about getting you there now that you've proven it but... I think you're right. I think in the future, our generation and younger, going to be a lot of people going I want you to prove to me before we start about funding this school.
Chris:        Prove to me first that you're going to work through it and you're going to get something out of it-
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        ... because it's ruining people's lives. In some cases... in a lot of cases no, but especially for people who aren't privileged. You're starting at such a deficit when you come out of it, and man is it not easy.
Chris:        Again, I'm not judging... you're a hustler, but the fact that you've just said you have a full-time job, then also drive Uber and also do work on the side at other places, is another thing that's reflective. Lot more people doing that and they're convincing us that this gig economy as they call it, is like oh yeah.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Find some fun work on the side and it's like, no it's not fun work on the side for everybody. A lot of times the cost of living has outpaced our ability to pay for life.
Caller:        Oh yeah. Yeah, big time. Big time. The cost of living is another bubble, I just don't want to get into it. That's nuts. Especially for... the reason why I had a kid so young, is because my girlfriend and I decided that we want to enjoy our kids. We don't want to be 40 and end up having kids... not saying there's anything wrong with that, but it's like we're young-
Chris:        You caught yourself.
Caller:        ... we want to go to Disney.
Chris:        Caught yourself. You caught yourself talking to a 37 year old guy who doesn't have a kid yet, and you said, not that there's anything wrong with that.
Caller:        Oh sorry no.
Chris:        You caught yourself.
Caller:        I did, I did, I did.
Caller:        We have... we want to go to Disney just as bad as he does, I still want to play with the same toys and Hot Wheels he has.
Chris:        Yeah, that's cool.
Caller:        I'm a kid at heart. The time came up... it's going pretty well. Pretty well.
Chris:        I bet with you with your dad not being around and then losing your dad, I bet there's also a part of you that's like... I want that childhood...
Caller:        Yeah, yeah.
Chris:        It's probably really important to you to make sure your kids childhood is that ideal one and is that one where you're really involved in all those aspects. I have to imagine there's that.
Caller:        Yeah. To a point where he might be a little spoiled, but I'll tone down a little bit after this first year.
Chris:        Yeah. I'm sure. There's no way your kids not going to work hard, right?
Caller:        Yeah, exactly.
Chris:        That's the starting point.
Caller:        Yeah he's going to know dads a kid, and he's going to know dads serious too. It's kind of learning how to balance the equilibrium between both really well.
Chris:        I-
Caller:        That's obviously what life is about. This world, I'm sorry but my way of viewing it is like, this world is kind of like... as far as we know this is an illusion. Right? So, you could treat it as it is. There's no reason not to laugh when you're sad. The whole point of this is to enjoy yourself while you're here and through my upbringing which hasn't been great, that's what I've learned.
Caller:        When times the worst, laugh at it. To be honest with you,-
Chris:        Oh really.
Caller:        ... it's only going on up.
Chris:        Oh really?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        When life's at its worst, laugh at it. Huh?
Caller:        Laugh. Laugh at it man.
Chris:        How does that go? How's that turn out for you?
Caller:        Well look at me now. You know, pretty well.
Chris:        Oh no. Oh no, we have less than a minute left. Oh, we couldn't have planned this better. Oh, no. Oh, this is my dream come true. This is everything... this is the stereotype of my career and this show is like, heartfelt emo bullshit, and then the most cockamamie thing that could possibly be layered with that. That's... STOP please! Stop!
Caller:        [inaudible 01:04:32].
Chris:        Oh my God. Oh my God I'm crouched over the garbage can. I'm crouched over a garbage can.
