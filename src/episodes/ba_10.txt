Beautiful / Anonymous - Episode 138 - House Burned Down


Chris:        Hello to all my Cedric the Donkey fans. Beautiful/Anonymous, one hour, one phone call, no names, no holds barred.
Chris:        Hi, everybody. It's Chris. It's Beautiful/Anonymous, where we take phone calls, but it's more than that. I don't know how to explain why it's more than that, but I think it is, and that's because of you guys and your support. Thank you for listening. A lot of you guys, if you have Stitcher Premium, you know that last Friday we dropped our first episode of our new sister series, Beautiful Follow-Ups. This is calls with past callers. We kicked it off last week with our vinyl market researcher, if you remember him, the guy who was thinking about sacrificing his whole livelihood to purchase a record store.
Chris:        This Friday we're putting out one that I think is very special to a lot of people. A lot of you guys have asked about Episode 69: Love is Everywhere, unforgettable episode. We recorded the follow-up, and it inspired me; it broke my heart; it made me feel more positive about the world. It was just a heartbreaking, sad conversation that also snapped me out of a funk that I had been in all day, and you're going to want to hear it. So check out Beautiful Follow-Ups on Stitcher Premium, stitcherpremium.com/stories. Use the promo code Stories, you get a free month and you get all of our back catalog and current episodes ad free. You also get a whole bunch of touring shows, so I think it's pretty good value.
Chris:        Last week's episode we talked with a mother who's raising mixed race children and had left a message after the 2016 election. We called her back and tied it into the midterm elections. I just want to put one thing out there. There was some reaction in the Facebook group, and I love it. The Facebook group I love, and a lot of this reaction was very, very civil in the method of discourse. I may have punctured a hole in that, for which I do apologize, but some people are saying they felt underrepresented as far as having political views that didn't match mine, which I can say, I get it. I understand it.
Chris:        To me, this show is about honesty, and I just try to be honest with myself. I do think that we'd have to agree that 2018, if you don't have opinions on politics, we're inundated by them, saturated with them, how can you not? It's hard for me to bite my tongue, and I promise you, I bite my tongue a lot. In my mind, in 50 years I want people to look back at episodes of this show the same way that it blows my mind when Ken Burns in The Civil War documentary will just read letters that soldiers sent home, and you're like, "That's real people in their own words." Diversity is very important to me, and a diversity of thought is as much a type of diversity as any other.
Chris:        If you are someone out there who feels like you are not represented on the show, whether that's your lifestyle, your culture, your background or yes, your political opinions, I want to hear from you. If we duke it out a little bit in the show, I'm not out here to make you look dumb, to condescend to you, to even get in a fight. We can have our moments that get tense, and we will shake hands before we hang up the phone, as much as one can shake hands being on a phone. You understand what I mean in the metaphor. Point being, voicemail line, I haven't plugged it in a while, 802-392-3288. If you've got something you want to talk about and you feel like it's not showing up on the show, call up, leave a voicemail, let us know. If you feel like I've been pushing things too far in some directions that cut out what represents you and your feelings in life, get them on.
Chris:        Okay, this week's episode. This was our live taping in Los Angeles at Dynasty Typewriter. This caller, so when we're all kids, there's a scenario that our parents walk us through. If you wake up in the middle of the night and our house is on fire, here's the plan. Meet me by this corner. Meet me by this tree. This is our meeting place. But you don't really know too many people who go through it. This week's caller went through that three or four days before placing this call and somehow still has positivity and a sense of humor. This call blew my mind, and I'm sending love to the caller and the family and the donkey. You'll see what I mean by that. Enjoy the call.
Speaker 2:        Thank you for calling Beautiful/Anonymous. A beeping noise will indicate when you are on the show with the host.
Caller:        Hi.
Chris:        Hi. How's it going?
Caller:        Oh my G.
Chris:        You okay?
Caller:        Yeah. This is wild. Oh my God, it's been such a crazy week, and I cannot believe this is actually happening right now. Hi, how are you?
Chris:        I'm good. I'm feeling really excited. Just so you know, I don't know if you were warned, this is one of our live shows, so I'm in front of a live audience. That's a little different than usual. They can contribute questions, but I promise you, they're all very nice and they got your back.
Caller:        Yeah, of course. How's everybody doing tonight?
Chris:        How's everybody doing tonight? There you go. I like how you worked the crowd for some cheap heat. I like that.
Caller:        This is awesome.
Chris:        Yeah. I'm pretty excited too.
Caller:        So what's going on, Chris?
Chris:        What's going on? Let's see. Haven't been home in almost two weeks, and I'm not even trying to be cheesy, but I really miss my wife. That's what's going on. I want to go home.
Caller:        I'm sure.
Chris:        I love you lots.
Caller:        You guys just seem like the perfect couple.
Chris:        We got our own problems too. Sometimes people say that and that's awful nice, but we're just regular people.
Caller:        No, you speak so highly of her though.
Chris:        She is incredible. I'm the one who sucks. I do, I do. We went and we did shows in London a few weeks ago, and I don't know if mentioned this on the podcast already, but I went on the London Eye, which is this big giant Ferris wheel sponsored by Coca-Cola in London. We got done with it, and my wife was like, "I can't believe you did that. That was so nice. I guess you're not scared of heights anymore." And I was like, "No, it's just that I caused an argument last night, so I thought this would make you happy. I love you more than I fear death is what's going on."
Caller:        That's awesome. See, you are great. You're giving her all the credit and look at you.
Chris:        I'm fine. Now, more importantly, how are you tonight?
Caller:        I am good. I'm good. I'm kind of freezing right now because what I told the engineer on the phone is that my house actually burned down on Sunday night.
Chris:        Whoa.
Caller:        When he asked me what I was up to. So I'm camping out on my family's property where the burned down house is, and it's really cold. I'm just hanging out on my couch with my electric blanket and my dogs and cats and trying to stay cozy.
Chris:        I'm so sorry that happened.
Caller:        Yeah. Thank you. It's all right. We're doing okay, actually.
Chris:        That's good. You said your house burned down Sunday and today is Wednesday. Today's Wednesday, so your house burned down three days ago.
Caller:        Yeah. In the middle of the night.
Chris:        I'm so sorry. I don't want to ask you a question out of the gate that sounds facetious, but I need to know this. My OCD is making me ask you this, and I apologize. I'm not trying to make a joke. What are you plugging the electric blanket into?
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        I'm so sorry.
Caller:        Let me back up and explain a little bit.
Chris:        I'm so sorry, I have to know.
Caller:        No. No, I completely understand because I moved back home a couple months ago from the West Coast, and I'm currently on the East Coast. I moved back and got a tiny house put on my mom's property, and it's not finished yet. It's not insulated or anything like that. It's basically just a shell with a little bit of furniture in it. So when the house burned down, we all just piled into my tiny house, and the community has really banded together to help us out. People have brought a camper for my mom and stepdad and my eight-year-old nephew to stay in. People have brought us... we've got three generators now so that we have power.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        Somebody, a retired CenturyLink employee, brought us a wifi router so we can keep in touch with people, so that's how I'm talking to you guys now.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        The generator is running my electric blanket.
Chris:        What a thorough and logical answer. Thank you for that. Thank you for that.
Caller:        You're welcome.
Chris:        What a beautiful thing that your whole community came together to help you out. That's awesome.
Caller:        It really is amazing. Well, we run a rescue animal farm, and between me and the rest of my family, we have seven dogs. So people have brought us dog food, cat food, horse food, chicken food, hay for the horses, stuff for us. It really is insane, so much money. Someone, I don't even know who did it, but somebody set up a GoFundMe, and there's thousands of dollars in there already in just a few days.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        It really is like I didn't cry over the house burning down even though it was devastating, but I've cried so many times just because of how heartwarming all of this is with all the love that's being thrown at us and all of the support and everything. It sucks, but it could be worse.
Chris:        Yeah. Now, I'll just ask just a couple questions that... Because this is also a traumatizing thing and it was three days ago, so feel free to just be like, hey, I just would like to move on from that. Do you know what caused the fire?
Caller:        Yeah. Well, it's a 150-year-old farmhouse that had a wood stove in it, and that's the only type of heat that it had. We had just replaced the wood stovepipe a couple years ago, and we had just cleaned the pipe out less than two weeks ago. We had burnt the wood stove five or six times already this season because it's been so cold, and I guess the fire just got too big. The pipe got so hot that it ignited a two by four in the wall, and then it just spread.
Chris:        Yeah. That horrible. You said it was in the middle of the night. I mean, that's like a thing they warn us about when we're kids, like, "If you wake up and there's a fire." And then I can't imagine the actual chaos when it happens.
Caller:        Right, yeah. It was kind of crazy. I was actually going to be sleeping in my tiny house that night, and then I realized how cold it was going to be, so I brought all my dogs and my cats up to the main house. When I stay up there when it's cold, I just sleep on the couch, which is right beside the room where the wood stove is. I was just laying there talking to one of my friends on the phone, and I heard the stove crackling, which is not really that uncommon.
Caller:        Then it just kept getting louder and louder, so I finally decided to jump up and run in there and check it out. I just ran up to the wood stove and was looking down at it and couldn't figure out what was going on. Then I finally looked up the wall, and the inside of the wall was just glowing with fire. So I looked above me, this is not funny, and I just can't believe it. So I looked above me, and the ceiling was on fire.
Chris:        That's brutal.
Caller:        So I just started running around the house and yeah, I went and banged on my mom's door and started hollering at them. They came out, and then we went and woke my nephew up and got all the dogs out of the house. We couldn't find my kitten for 15 minutes until the house was all smoked up really.
Chris:        Wait. You're breaking up a little bit. Can you hear me?
Caller:        Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
Chris:        Yeah. That's better. Don't worry. I'm not mad at you. You got enough shit going on without me getting mad at you. Can you go somewhere with a better phone connection, please?
Caller:        See, there's a delicate balance between close to the wifi and close to the plug for the electric blanket, so I'm straddling the middle.
Chris:        You just crushed it in Los Angeles. They loved you for that. So you saved everybody. Your house burned down. You saved everybody, huh?
Caller:        Oh, no, no. Well, yeah, I guess. My mom...
Chris:        We all think you did, I think.
Caller:        My mom keeps telling people that, and it's just, I mean when I really think about it, yes, but still, I don't know. You know what? The ironic thing is that my stepdad is on the fire department.
Chris:        Oh, wow. They must be really razzing him. Is he getting razzed?
Caller:        Yeah. Oh my gosh, yeah. Yeah. He tried his best. He's really upset that he couldn't save the house, but there was really nothing he could do about it.
Chris:        Yeah. That's brutal. When you cut out a little bit, you were telling us about the fate of a kitten, and I feel like I cannot move on because I think people are really worried about what happened with the kitten.
Caller:        Oh, the kitten is totally fine.
Chris:        Good. Good, good, good.
Caller:        His 17-year-old mother is fine. They're great, laying beside me right now on the electric blanket. Yeah, he was just hiding behind the couch. I think my mom found him and threw him to me while I was standing halfway in the front door, but we got all seven dogs out of the house, both of the cats out of the house, all the people. We even saved the geckos. We have two geckos.
Chris:        So you just kept running in and out saving animals?
Caller:        Yeah, basically. While I was waiting for my mom to come out of her room and do something about this mess, I got my dogs outside, and they just ran out and stayed there and looked at me like, "What the hell is going on?" Then when I tried to get my mom's dogs outside, she has three Great Danes and a mastiff, I got them all outside. They know how to come around the back door and open it themselves.
Chris:        Oh, no.
Caller:        So they did that and came directly into the room where the fire was. A lot of it was my stepdad trying to get the fire out, my mom grabbing belongings, and me keeping the animals out of the house.
Chris:        So it was like a really fucked up, unfunny Marx Brothers routine. You could put the dogs out the front door, and they keep running in the back.
Caller:        Yeah. It was like a racetrack basically.
Chris:        Your mom's throwing a gecko at you from across the room.
Caller:        My mom is really hilarious, and she doesn't even know it. I was watching her going to save the geckos, and there's a male and a female. They're in two separate cages so we don't have babies. She opens one of the lids, grabs the gecko, throws it in the cage with the other gecko and goes, "Y'all better fucking behave," and then hands the cage to me and tells me to take it outside.
Chris:        I got to say, here's the thing I noticed, you guys really love animals, and obviously because you have so many. But here you've done something twice now that I find so fascinating, which is you talked about all the different types of food that people brought over, and you were like, "Dog food, cat food, horse food, hay for the horses, chicken food, also some human food." Then you did it this time as well. There was another time you said, "We got all the cats out and all the dogs out. We got the geckos out, all the humans out." You listed humans fourth or fifth. Your family really has done a lot of right by animals, huh?
Caller:        Yeah. We love them. We've never not had animals. My mom grew up with animals. We always...
Chris:        Okay. You gotta move back towards the wifi.
Caller:        Oh, I'm sorry.
Chris:        It's okay. What can I do to get you an extension cord so the blanket can...
Caller:        I have an extension cord. I have so many extension cords. They don't help. All right. Give me a second. Let me try to re-situate.
Chris:        Now can I ask, there must've been a moment, was there a crazy moment... So the house burns down. That's very traumatic. Everybody's freaked out. You're standing in the yard. It's you, your parents are there; you've got at least one nephew you mentioned. You got two geckos, two horny-ass geckos. You got a bunch of large dogs. You've got a kitten and cats. Then is everybody just standing there next to the burned down house and just slowly look at all of each other and then turn towards the tiny house and realize that you all have to fit in there?
Caller:        Well, that would be the movie version of it. Real life, it was a lot more complicated because, so I called 911 basically immediately. Then my stepdad started spraying the house down with the water hose. I mean, that obviously didn't really do a whole lot. Then my stepdad's best friend is a cop in town, and he heard the call come over the scanner and knew that it was our address. So he comes barreling down the driveway sideways.
Caller:        They grab both water hoses and everybody's just scrambling to try to get this fire out. Then the fire department finally shows up, and apparently they have a dysfunctional truck or something that has a leak, so they brought an empty truck first.
Chris:        Oh, son of a bitch.
Caller:        So there was no water until the second truck got here.
Chris:        That's infuriating.
Caller:        Yeah. My mom was walking around the yard just screaming at the air like someone was ripping her heart out. It was really insane.
Chris:        I'm sorry I made that joke about the tiny house because it...
Caller:        No. Please make all of the jokes because we have been just deliriously laughing about the whole situation because that's all you can do, honestly. What else are you going to do, just sit around and cry all day?
Chris:        I think some people would say, yeah, that's totally warranted. Some would say, if you're on an outdoor couch in the East Coast cold huddled under an electric blanket, yeah, I think you're allowed to cry if you want. But it's very nice and strong and reflective of you that you're pushing forward. Is there a plan in place? I know it's only been a few days. What's the plan here to get back on your feet?
Caller:        I'm not really sure yet because we rented the house, and we found out the other day that the landlord only had it insured for $40,000, which is a decent amount of money, but even the cleanup of the house we've been given estimates that are a quarter of that, so that doesn't really leave us a whole lot to work with. The landlord said that if we want to stay here, we can try to make it work.
Caller:        My mom lost it a little bit today and got sick of the clutter and not having running water and all of that stuff, and she called the same company that we got my tiny house from and ordered a tiny house exactly like mine. That'll be here in a few weeks, and the rest of my family will be staying in the new tiny house. I'm not really sure where we're going to go from here.
Chris:        Wow. It sounds like, did you say at one point your family runs an animal sanctuary, that that's part of why there's so many animals?
Caller:        It's an unofficial animal sanctuary.
Chris:        Got it, got it.
Caller:        My mom calls it a rescue farm, but we take basically every animal in five counties that could use a home. So we've got all kinds of birds. We've got a couple goats. We have a longhorn cow, like I said, the horses. We have a donkey. At one point we rescued an iguana, a hedgehog.
Chris:        A hedgehog?
Caller:        Her name is Matilda.
Chris:        Matilda the hedgehog. Don't hedgehogs just live in the wild? Was it hurt? Was it injured?
Caller:        Well, they don't live in the wild here. They do in Asia, I think.
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        It gets too cold here.
Chris:        I guess I'm an idiot who doesn't know enough about hedgehogs.
Caller:        No.
Chris:        I am. I am an idiot who doesn't know enough about hedgehogs. You know what? Your family sounds like really, really great people and just about the last people... Nobody deserves something like that, but it sounds like you guys are the least. You know what? We have a hashtag set up for me to ask questions from the crowd. I'm going to check it. I will say the majority of the contributions thus far are people in the crowd begging other people in the crowd to stop eating their popcorn so loudly.
Caller:        That would be me if I were sitting there.
Chris:        Yeah. And the popcorn here is delicious, I will say that. One person did point out, "Hey, there's audience mikes, and it's just going to be the sound of people chomping popcorn." Okay. Luke says, "I might have missed this, did you say you have a donkey?" Luke says he wants to know the donkey's name.
Caller:        The donkey's name is Cedric.
Chris:        Cedric the donkey. You are the most adorable family, and I can't even fathom you being in this much duress. Okay. Gina says, "$40,000 is one month's rent in Los Angeles."
Caller:        Oh my gosh.
Chris:        Everybody loves the pets. Ryan wants to know, "What's the weirdest, strangest name of all the pets?"
Caller:        Cedric is a pretty weird one. I've got some weird names for my chickens.
Chris:        What are we talking here?
Caller:        There's Peggy Comb Over because she has a floppy comb. There's one named Maya Angelou.
Chris:        The chicken? The chicken is named Maya Angelou?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Floppy Comb Over and Maya Angelou are the chickens.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I can't.
Caller:        It's a lovely name.
Chris:        Here's the thing. I'm going to tell you, I'm going to be very honest with you, I'm making a lot of jokes in this one, and it's because if I let myself feel any of the pain of your situation, I'm going to feel all of it. It's hard because you guys sound like the best.
Caller:        No. It's really not. You know what? Let me tell you the thing, everyone else is freaking out about this a million times more than we are, honestly. We are sitting in the tiny house every night playing Uno because that's what my nephew loves to do. We have lived in kind of half-assed situations before. Oh my gosh, you will get a kick out of this, and you're going to think my family's crazy. When I was little, we lived in an underground house.
Chris:        What?
Caller:        Right? I told you.
Chris:        Like a bunker?
Caller:        Kind of. I mean, okay, picture there's a big hill, so they basically just moved the hill to the side and then built a rectangular house out of concrete and then moved the hill back onto the roof of it so that the front of it was still visible but the rest of it was underground.
Chris:        Was this for a cooling/heating type of thing, like an environmental concern?
Caller:        Yeah. Mostly. Yeah, mostly. It was supposed to be run off of solar power, but it was like this big vision that this old man in the community had. Then he was a pilot, and he had all of these tiny one or two-person planes. He actually ended up flying one of his planes off of the roof of the house when they got it mostly finished but not completely done, and then he wrecked that plane on the property and died. So the place wasn't finished.
Caller:        It was supposed to have solar power, but it didn't, so the entire place the entire time we lived there, which was three or four years, was run off of a generator. With that comes a lot of really weird shit that you have to deal with, like waking up in the middle of the night and gassing the generator up.
Chris:        We need you to get back towards the wifi.
Caller:        I'm as close to it as I can get.
Chris:        Well, I'm sorry.
Caller:        Can you hear me now?
Chris:        I can, I can. You were just telling us about how you lived in a box that a madman installed in the side of a hill.
Caller:        Yeah. And we actually called it the hill.
Chris:        Yeah, I bet you did.
Caller:        That's what the house was called.
Chris:        Of course. What else are you going to call it? That's incredible.
Caller:        Right.
Chris:        Let me ask you something, a total respectful question, because I feel like as I'm piecing together some of your life story... What's up with your parents? Are they like old school hippies or something?
Caller:        My mom is a little bit of a hippie. See, I grew up in the South. She was raised kind of like a redneck, but deep down she was always a hippie. So she's like a farm hippie that still lives in this really tiny town in the South, and she's kind of walking the line between the two, if that makes sense.
Chris:        Sounds awesome. She sounds cool.
Caller:        She is cool. She's really cool. She's self-employed, and she's been killing it in her own business for 15 years now. She makes killer money and does what she loves and lives a really simple life. She's great.
Chris:        Yeah. You're living in the hill, living on the animal sanctuary. Now you're switching to the tiny houses. You guys just make it work, huh?
Caller:        Right. Yeah. My point of telling you about the hill was that we've had to deal with weird living situations, and the hill does not stand alone. There's many more to add to that list. We're good. We have all of the stuff that we need, and it's obviously cold at night, but if that's the worst thing that we have to deal with, then it's okay.
Chris:        Yeah. One person here said something that I think we're all thinking in the room, which is that, "For someone who's currently going through so much, you're a very uplifting person." I think that that's something that we're all blown away by. Also, four different people pointed out that it sounds like you lived in a hobbit house.
Caller:        It was a lot like a hobbit house.
Chris:        Yeah. It sounds a lot like the house that Bilbo lived in.
Caller:        Actually, you guys are going to hate me right now because I'm going to sound so ignorant, but I have never even seen that movie. It's from Lord of the Rings, right?
Chris:        Yes. We're not going to hate you. There's nothing you can say that would make... You would have to go so hard in an unexpected direction to get this crowd to hate you as you tell us about your journey to save kittens that are trapped behind burning couches and then this immense positivity about how if the worst your family is is cold, then you're going to be okay. And you think you're going to hate you because you haven't seen fucking Lord of the Rings? No, it probably just reflects that you're out there living more of a full life than the rest of us pop-culture-obsessed fucking jerks. You're too busy raising Cedric the donkey, too busy raising donkeys and geckos. You're too busy for Lord of the Rings.
Caller:        Cedric the donkey.
Chris:        What's that?
Caller:        You want to know something really cute and wholesome about Cedric the donkey?
Audience:        Yes.
Caller:        He has these big, tall, floppy ears, and usually he holds them straight up in the air. But if you walk up to him and put your hand flat on his forehead, his ears go limp, and if you take your hand off of his forehead, his ears go up. It's like there's a button on his forehead that turns his ears on and off. I just think it's the greatest thing in the world
Chris:        So do all of us. All of us love Cedric the donkey.
Caller:        Everyone loves Cedric the donkey. He's wonderful.
Chris:        What's the cutest thing Floppy Comb Over does?
Caller:        Comb Over doesn't really do a whole lot. None of my chickens really do a whole lot because they're really old. We didn't rescue them because they weren't in a bad situation.
Chris:        Oh, you're breaking you a little bit.
Caller:        Is there background noise?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        All right. Well, I'm going closer to the wifi, so maybe that'll make it better.
Chris:        Yes. It's getting better again. Now, do you think-
Caller:        That better?
Chris:        Yes. Can I ask you another question? You keep a chicken named Maya Angelou domestically. I imagine you keep it in some sort of cage or pen. Do you think it's weird to keep a bird in a cage named after someone who's most famous work is called I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings?
Caller:        You have a really great point, and I didn't really think about that. But I think Maya Angelou appreciates her life because she gets plenty of snacks all time, and she gets fresh organic fruits and vegetable scraps.
Chris:        Oh, wow.
Caller:        And she gets loved on every day. I think she's pretty appreciative of the life.
Chris:        That's good, that's good.
Caller:        You shouldn't worry about Maya Angelou, but you have a good point. I appreciate that.
Chris:        You're the best. I'm so happy that you called, and I hope that this is providing a little bit of a respite from everything that's going on. Katie in the crowd says, "Lord of the Rings is the worst anyway. Not missing anything." Mother of puppies says, "Don't feel bad, caller, I've never seen Lord of the Rings either." Zoe says, "Cuteness level overload." Marlow wants to know, "Does Cedric the donkey have an Instagram?"
Caller:        I'm sorry. You broke up. Does Cedric the donkey have what?
Chris:        Instagram. I think people want to see a video of them ears going up and down.
Caller:        Oh, no. Cedric the donkey does not have Instagram. My dogs have Instagram, but not Cedric the donkey.
Chris:        Your dog has Instagram. Oh, John Luke says, "Don't disrespect Gandalf." How about that, how about that? Someone wants to know, "Who in your family is best at Uno?"
Caller:        Oh, man. Probably my mom. She kicks ass.
Chris:        That's fair. She just beats the shit out of your nephew, who loves Uno?
Caller:        Okay. I don't understand what's going on right now because I moved way closer to the wifi, and now I can barely hear you guys.
Chris:        It's okay. Listen, listen, listen, sometimes people who listen to the podcast will complain when there's slight technical difficulties like this, and I will remind anyone listening, before you decide to vent on the internet about the audio going in and out, this person's house burned down on Sunday. So before you give into the desire to be a fucking disconnected from humanity internet troll about it, she's huddled under an electric blanket that's plugged into a generator while you tweet about sound quality from the warmth of your fucking home that still exists.
Caller:        I appreciate you, Chris. Thank you for having my back.
Chris:        I appreciate you too, and I want to have your back even harder. I'm going to ask you to consider something. You can take your time with it. I don't want to put any pressure on it, but I've only done this once before in the history of the podcast, and it's been about two years since I've done it. But hearing your story, I think I would agree that this entire community is one that would like to support you. If you'd like to say the address of that GoFundMe page, even though it will make you less anonymous, and if you want to retain the anonymity, I think that that's a-okay as well. You should not feel pressure, but I have a feeling that a lot of the people who are listening to this would love to contribute, so that's up to you. That's up to you.
Caller:        Oh my gosh. That would be so wonderful. I would actually have to look it up because I don't even know what name or anything it's under. We just got the wifi this morning, so I haven't even checked it. I've just heard that there's a bunch of money in it and stuff. Do you want me to give it to you now or what?
Chris:        Well, if you can't find it now, then I think, I mean Devon, we're keeping our caller's number, right, so we can get back in touch later and make sure that I say it as part of the intro and outro of the show. But if you have it now, I think people would lose their minds. If people understand that they have a chance to give Cedric the donkey a home again...
Caller:        Cedric, it's all for Cedric, people.
Chris:        Can you ride Cedric? Can you ride a donkey? I don't know.
Caller:        Yeah. We also have a mule that you can ride. She's a lot cooler to ride. Her name is Poppy.
Chris:        Her name is what?
Caller:        Poppy, like the flower.
Chris:        Poppy?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        Poppy the mule. Is Poppy friends with Cedric?
Caller:        I don't really think so, actually. She's in a different kind of paddock.
Chris:        Oh, they're like a little odd couple.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah, that would be pretty funny. I don't really know that they've met, honestly.
Chris:        How have they not met? They're two quadrupeds living on the farm.
Caller:        Well, this is a pretty big place. I mean, we've got like 60 acres here and a few different pastures because we've got the horses that we've had forever, and then we have rescue horses that, we call them hard keepers because they need extra feed and extra loving because they're really skinny and old and sick and stuff like that. Poppy is actually in with the hard keepers to keep the coyotes away because mules are really good at that, and we don't want old, sick horses being eaten by wild dogs.
Chris:        Why do bad things happen to such good people? That wasn't a joke.
Caller:        Bad things happen to everyone.
Chris:        I guess that's... Now can I ask you, god forbid the horses, the old horses that you protect were attacked by coyotes. I have a feeling if one of the coyotes injured a leg in the process of attacking the horses, would your family take in the coyote?
Caller:        It's possible. It's possible. We love everything, honestly. I mean, if a coyote tried to take down a horse, it would be because they were hungry, so obviously we wouldn't bring a coyote here and let it around things that it could kill. I really couldn't even tell you that we would try to save a coyote or that we would even be able to start doing that.
Chris:        I was mostly kidding.
Caller:        But if I walked out of my house tomorrow and there was a coyote that was hurt that was laying on the ground, I would probably take care of it.
Chris:        Yeah. And you'd give it a cute name like Jim or Burt, right?
Caller:        Probably.
Chris:        Andrew's asking, "Coyotes are scared of mules?" That's true. I never thought of them as natural enemies, coyotes and mules.
Caller:        I don't really know that a coyote would see a mule and be like, "Holy shit, we need to get out of here," but mules are notorious for kicking predators and keeping them away. We can't let the dogs in the pasture with Poppy or anything like that because she will just instinctively try to smash them.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        You know? You know?
Chris:        Yeah. Poppy's a tough customer.
Caller:        Let me tell you about this. Because we're getting so carried away with Cedric and Poppy that I need to tell you that a couple months ago I actually moved back here from San Diego, so I was living really close to where you guys are at now.
Chris:        Yeah. Just a couple hours south of here.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        How'd you like it?
Caller:        It was good. It was major culture shock and I had never really spent time in the city or anything like that. Where I grew up, there's an organic biodynamic permaculture fancy farm right down the road from me, and my mom is really good friends with the lady who owns it. A guy moved there from Jersey actually to work on the farm, and we ended up meeting.
Caller:        So I moved onto the farm and worked there and lived with them and dated him for a few years, and then we decided that we wanted to get out of here and do bigger things. So we lined up a job on a farm in Santa Barbara, and we were trying to figure out how to get there. We decided to make an event out of it, so we actually built a mini-camper or a micro-camper, basically. It actually took us across the country.
Chris:        Oh, wait. You're breaking up.
Caller:        Oh, I'm sorry. I'm right beside the router.
Chris:        That's okay. You're coming back. You're coming back. I just want to make sure we hear the story. So you built a micro-camper with this Jersey guy.
Caller:        Yeah. Then we took a month-long trip across the country zig-zagging back and forth and seeing things and stuff like that. The job in Santa Barbara fell through, and we ended up moving down to San Diego where his family lives so we could have a support system. Then things started going crazy there, and I was losing my mind in the city. We were growing apart, and then my dad got diagnosed with cancer back home on the East Coast. And my mom adopted my eight-year-old nephew because he was taken away from his family by CPS.
Caller:        It was just a lot of crazy stuff going on at home, so I decided to move back. What I did was convert my minivan into basically a living situation and took a three-week trip home. I went up to Washington first and then across the northern part of the country. Then I went to Jersey and saw some friends and then came down the East Coast, and here I am...
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        In the tiny house with the electric blanket talking to Chris Gethard and the Beautiful/Anonymous audience.
Chris:        Indeed, indeed. When you got all that stuff going on, a breakup, an illness, and the situation with your nephew and you do a solo road trip, you must've done a lot of soul searching on that road trip, huh?
Caller:        Yeah. It was a lot. I had my dogs with me, and I had a good support system all over the country. I stopped by and saw quite a few friends and family members and stuff going across the country, so it worked out, but it was kind of wild and really fun.
Chris:        Yeah. How's your dad doing?
Caller:        He's good. He had a few organs removed and lymph nodes removed and stuff like that. He will be doing his last round of chemo I believe next Friday.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        They think he's in the clear.
Chris:        That's beautiful. We're sending him the best. We're sending him the best.
Caller:        Thank you, guys. You are so nice, all of you.
Chris:        You're nicer than all of us. By a round of applause, who thinks this person on the phone is a nicer human being than they are?
Caller:        No. No, no way.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah. How's your nephew feeling?
Caller:        Well, this is great.
Chris:        How's your nephew feeling? Is he doing good?
Caller:        He is wonderful. He is a really great kid. He's doing great in school even since... Okay, so the house caught on fire around 11:00 p.m., and they didn't get it out until like 3:00 a.m. He stayed awake basically that whole time, and around 4:00 or 4:30 in the morning he asked me if he was going to get to go to school. He was like, "School is in a couple hours, and do you think you could take me because I think me-maw's a little too busy with the house?" I was like, "I think you should probably just sleep all day, buddy."
Caller:        Yeah, he aced his spelling test this week, and we haven't even gotten a chance to pull his book bag out and make him study his spelling words or anything. So I have no idea how he's killing it so hard, but he kept it together the whole time, and he's still good.
Chris:        What a good kid he sounds like. I'm glad everybody's doing all right. I'm glad everybody's doing all right.
Caller:        He really is great.
Chris:        Yeah. My heart continues to bleed thinking about that house, but I'm really glad that you guys are there taking care of each other. I think that's really... Where was that guy from in Jersey, what town?
Caller:        Yeah. Boonton.
Chris:        Yeah, you can't trust guys from Boonton. I used to go see punk shows at Boonton Elks Lodge, and you always had to watch your back a little bit in Boonton. Everybody in Boonton's got a little chip on their shoulder like they got something to prove. Nah, Boonton's fine.
Caller:        That's funny. He's actually, he's a really great guy, and I still miss him a lot. We talk pretty often, and we stay in touch. And we check up on each other and stuff like that. It just got to the point where the relationship wasn't as happy as it could be or mutually beneficial anymore, so we both just called it quits and decided not to do any more damage.
Chris:        I think that that's fair and mature and wise if that's the thing you had to say. Someone, this name is very beautiful, a little unusual. I apologize if I mispronounce it, Garima asks a question that I think is a real powder keg with you. "If you had to say, what's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you?"
Caller:        Oh my god. Well, how much time do we have?
Chris:        14 minutes and 32 seconds.
Caller:        Sorry, what was that? Okay, 14 minutes?
Chris:        Yeah. Just under. Yeah, 14 minutes.
Caller:        Well, so another time when I was little, I was about eight years old, I woke up in the morning and came out into the living room. We had a wood stove in the living room again, and there was a big huge log just on the carpet, and the carpet was all charred. There was charcoal all over the place, and it was just a complete mess. I started freaking out and asking my mom what was going on and whatever.
Caller:        She goes, "Well, there was a chimney fire last night, and you slept through it." I said, "What?" She said, "The chimney caught on fire last night, and you slept through it. We were on the roof with water hoses putting it out, and the smoke alarms were going off." There was just a lot of commotion that I didn't even hear, so that was a little crazy to find out.
Chris:        You're telling us that the craziest thing that happened in your life is a less severe fire than the one that happened on Sunday?
Caller:        Well, I already told you about that story, so I have to tell you about something different.
Chris:        I can't even handle you. It's too positive and too sweet. I can't believe that's what you went with, what's the craziest thing that ever happened? "Oh, a little fire that we actually put out." Oh my god.
Caller:        Well, that's kind of crazy.
Chris:        It is.
Caller:        I mean, all of the really crazy stuff is if you're freaking out about this house fire, you would completely lose your shit about the craziest things that have happened in my life. Let me tell you about this story. The same nephew that lives with us now, his mom, who we're not related to, used to be addicted to drugs. She was just going down this really rough path and not taking care of herself and stuff. When my nephew was about two months old, she came and dropped him off with us and said she was going to pick him up in a couple days. He ended up staying with us for a while.
Caller:        I was 12 at the time, and my nephew was sleeping with me. He had woken me up in the middle of the night to eat, so I was just laying on the couch with him feeding him his bottle. I turned the TV on. We were just hanging out, and then all of a sudden I hear footsteps coming through the house and the door opening. I just sat there waiting to see what happened, and the footsteps kept... I could see my mom's bedroom door from there, and there was no one else in the house, so I knew it wasn't her. I just waited until I saw a shadow come around the corner. I jumped up on the couch and I covered the baby up with a blanket, and thank God he didn't cry or anything. I went around the corner, and it was one of my brother's ex-friends, who was also having a really rough time in his life. I guess he was wasted on drugs or alcohol or something like that.
Caller:        Anyhow, long story short, he came in the house demanding money from a 12-year-old who was taking care of a two-month-old baby at 3:00 in the morning. Yeah, I just went and got my mom, and we handled that situation and kicked him out and locked our doors. That was kind of crazy.
Chris:        Yeah, it was. You had us all sitting here on eggshells. Now, your mom yelled at some geckos to not play grab ass. How does she handle someone who tries to show up rob her family at 3:00 a.m.?
Caller:        She's feisty. My mom, she's really tiny. She's only like five-foot-four, and she's just a natural firecracker. All of our family's friends and basically anyone who knows her knows not to mess with her. Once she came out of her room, the guy even though he was wasted, was like, "I'm done here. I'm not going to do this anymore." It wasn't...
Chris:        Oh, wait. You're breaking up.
Caller:        That hard to get him out of the house.
Chris:        We're breaking.
Caller:        It wasn't that hard to get him out of the house.
Chris:        Sounds like in those situations your mom-
Caller:        Can you hear me?
Chris:        Yeah. We can hear you now. Sounds like in those situations your mom dials down the hippie and dials up the redneck, huh?
Caller:        Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Chris:        Wow. You've lived a lot of life.
Caller:        That's exactly how it is.
Chris:        How old are you? Can I ask how old you are?
Caller:        I am...
Chris:        What's that? We got to get you...
Caller:        I just turned in August...
Chris:        What was that? You broke up a little.
Caller:        I just turned 21.
Chris:        21. We couldn't hear. We heard you're in your 20s, and I'll warn you, there is one person in particular in this crowd who is very mad that we didn't get the exact age. Everyone else was frustrated, and one person went, "What?"
Caller:        Oh my god.
Chris:        How old are you?
Caller:        I'm 21. I just turned 21 a couple months ago.
Chris:        You've lived all this life in 21 years. Wow, you've been through a lot. Wow, and you are this positive. When I was 21, I wasn't dealing with any of this and I was so fucking bitter and angry and sad. I wasn't nearly as positive.
Caller:        I have my bitter times. I've struggled with anxiety, depression all throughout my life since I was a child, basically, but I'm an optimist naturally. But I also have mental illnesses, so it's a flip-flop back and forth between I could just be here and waste away and everything's going to be all right. There's a balance, and you caught me in a good mood.
Chris:        I'm glad for that, and I hope we help to keep you in good mood at least for an hour. Sounds like we have something in common. A lot of people on Twitter from the crowd, and I don't think they're saying this facetiously. They've heard your two stories. There are three or four people who have said some version of, "Please don't move into another house with a wood burning stove."
Caller:        Well, my mom really likes old farmhouses.
Chris:        We know. We know.
Caller:        I think after this point, our new house, I don't know, I'm saying whenever we get it, it probably will not have a wood stove in it.
Chris:        Okay, thank god, thank god. There's people suggesting maybe a house with stone walls. That's good. It's great that your mom likes the rustic feel, but at a certain point we've got to just... Vanessa says she would like it if you became the president of the United States.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Now, I got a question for you. When you're feeling those low moments, which animal do you turn to the most to cheer you up?
Caller:        My dogs in general, but one dog specifically. I have this real ridiculous...
Chris:        Hold on. You're breaking up.
Caller:        Particularly close with me.
Chris:        You're breaking up. Let's get by the wifi. Let's get by the wifi. You're breaking up, and we all want to know about these dogs. Even though I will say that I've mentioned this on the podcast before.
Caller:        Oh my god.
Chris:        I've mentioned this on the podcast before and people have come after me, I'm not a dog person. It's all cat-
Caller:        Really?
Chris:        Yeah. Someone in the crowd just hissed at me for it too. Never been a dog person.
Caller:        That's okay.
Chris:        Thank you, caller.
Caller:        I'm just an animal person in general. I love my dogs and my cats equally and the goats. I love my chickens as much as I love my dogs, so that's just how it goes sometimes.
Chris:        You love your chickens as much as your dog. That was weird because we could hear you, but it was breaking up a little bit and gave it this weird sound effect that made it sound like we were all high on something. I like that version of the wifi issue. Well, caller, we only got a few minutes left.
Caller:        Honestly, I really thought it was going to be better.
Chris:        What's that?
Caller:        I said I'm really sorry about the connection issues. I really thought it would be better. I am literally less than 10 feet away from the router. I just want you guys to know this right now. I'm sitting outside where it's 40 degrees, and I'm trying my best.
Chris:        That's why I love Beautiful/Anonymous fans. They give an extended applause break for the idea of trying your best. That is the fan base of this podcast in a nutshell right there. Nobody's mad at you. That's fine, some connection issues. That's okay. That's okay. We've had connection issues from people where I'm like, "Hey, can you go stand in some place that's not windy?" And they're like, "No, I don't feel like it." You're outside. You're outside. Listen, we got three minutes left. What should we talk about?
Caller:        Oh my gosh.
Chris:        What should we talk about in our closing three minutes? You've been very inspiring, very charming. A lot of people love you. A lot of people love Cedric. We're all rooting for you. We're rooting for your family.
Caller:        This is amazing. Thank you guys so much. I just feel so heart warmed and lovely right now. I cannot even believe that this is happening. I've been trying to get through. I know everyone says this, but I've been trying to get through on this show for, I mean years, since it started. I listened since the first episode came out.
Chris:        Thank you.
Caller:        And it just so happens that I got through right after the craziest thing that's happened to me.
Chris:        Yeah. What were you going to talk about before your house burned down?
Caller:        Mostly, I mean there's been so many crazy things that have happened that were like the biggest thing in my life at the time, and then something else crazy would happen, so probably all of those things. But I'm forgetting all of those things during this call because of this most recent crazy ass thing that's happened.
Chris:        Totally valid.
Caller:        Yeah. I mean, I always have something to talk about.
Chris:        Now we got a few comments coming in that I like. We got someone who pointed out that the sound effect where you sounded high apparently did happen when it was exactly 4:20 on the screen behind me. I like that one.
Caller:        Oh my god.
Chris:        John Luke says, "Steve Irwin doesn't have shit on her." I like that one. Oh, Ryan says, "Is the dog you turn to for comfort the same one who has the Instagram page?"
Caller:        Well, all three of them have an Instagram page, but he's on the Instagram page a lot because he's beautiful.
Chris:        Okay, that's fair. Then human being wants to know a question that I think is incredible. I think what we all want to know is if the geckos behaved themselves? Get near that router. Let's-
Caller:        So we might have baby geckos and I will definitely get in touch with the community mods and let everyone know if that happens.
Chris:        No, wait. The first half of your answer cut out. It sounds like the geckos fucked. That's what it sounds like. Is that what we're cooking up on here with 30 seconds left?
Caller:        It's possible.
Chris:        Those geckos in the passionate heat of that glowing fire, they said, "We're overcome by this romantic scene, and this is our one chance. I've been staring at you through that glass for months now." What are the geckos' names? We've got 10 seconds left. What are the geckos' names?
Caller:        They don't have names. I don't know.
Chris:        What?
Caller:        I mean, they might, but I don't know them. I'm sorry. I wish I did.
Chris:        That's how this ends. How about that caller? Thank you for calling. Thank you for maintaining such humor and positivity. It was a pleasure to talk to you. I think I can speak for the crowd in Los Angeles. As promised in the course of the episode, we are breaking anonymity for the second time in a hundred and something episodes here. If you want to maintain the anonymity of the caller, now is the time to plug your ears for a second. If you want to see more about this caller's GoFundMe, it's very easy to remember, gofundme.com/y8hkps-house-fire. How about those donkeys and those geckos? Thank you so much, caller, again.
Chris:        Thanks to everybody who came out in LA. It was so cool to meet all you guys. You're really nice. A bunch of you bought books. It means a lot. Thank you to our engineer, Devon Bryant, out there in LA fighting the good fight, not easy. You thought it was going to be easier than it was. You were cocky about it when I first talked to you. Thank you to Jared O'Connell and Harry Nelson back at the home base here in New York. Thank you to Justin Linville. Thank you to Shellshag for the music. Thanks to all you guys who are listening. If you want to help the show, go to Apple Podcasts, rate, review, subscribe. Helps a lot when you do. That's all the business. We'll see you next time on Beautiful/Anonymous.
