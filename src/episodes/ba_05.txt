Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Hello. Hey.
Caller:        Hi.
Chris:        How's it going?
Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Yeah. What's up?
Caller:        Is this Chris?
Chris:        Yeah, what's up?
Caller:        How are you man?
Chris:        Pretty good.
Caller:        I love your hold music.
Chris:        You like the hold music, yeah, I curated it myself.
Caller:        That Billy Bragg song man, so fucking good.
Chris:        Wait, which were the standout tracks?
Caller:        The Billy Bragg Song. The New England is like one of my favorite songs of all time.
Chris:        Yeah mine too. It's actually my favorite song of all time.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah, I think might be with you on that for today.
Chris:        For today. That's cool.
Caller:        Yeah, why not? Just for today.
Chris:        Well I'm glad ... do I detect an accent? Do I detect an accent my friend?
Caller:        Yes, I'm from the deep south.
Chris:        You're from the deep south of the United States.
Caller:        Of the united States. I'm from Australia originally.
Chris:        So the ...
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You.
Caller:        If you say anything about barbecues or shrimp I'm going to hang up.
Chris:        Okay. No Crocodile Dundee jokes for me.
Caller:        Just a warning. You are towing the line mate, you are towing the line.
Chris:        Hey man I was agreeing with you. Here's list of things I won't bring up. I promise you I will not bring up Crocodile Dundee, I will not use the phrase shrimp on the barbie, I'll barely bring up kangaroos but no promises on that one. I will almost definitely bring up the duck-billed platypus because I need to know what's going on there. Sound fair?
Caller:        I understand that.
Chris:        So are you calling from Australia?
Caller:        I'm in New York, I live here now.
Chris:        That's cool. Thanks for calling. Anything in particular that you wanted to get into or should we just let it flow, whatever you want you?
Caller:        I've got to say that I think it's important me to articulate that hearing the way that you talk about mental illness and mental health and your experiences with depression bipolarity has given me so much hope. I remember hearing a talk you gave a little while ago and you articulated things that I could never find the words for so thank you for what you're doing. Really, it means a lot to me and I think a lot of.
Chris:        Oh, thanks. That's awfully nice, that's awfully nice. Thank you so much.
Caller:        For me or for you, I hope it's for me?
Chris:        No, it's super nice. I don't want to mention, you just heard people clap at that. I think you saw when I put out the tweet it's a live show, don't be worried about it, everybody here in Baltimore's super nice. The only thing that's different is they can send me questions on my computer for you so I might reference their questions, outside of that totally regular episode. Cool? Does that sound okay?
Caller:        That sounds good, yeah. Can you still hear me?
Chris:        Great. Well that's nice, no, I'm glad to help. I was very scared to put that stuff out there but people embraced it very warmly and hearing things like that is a part of why I felt like it was worth going for, that it might clear some things up.
Caller:        Yeah, what's really magically I think about sharing your story and that magical feeling. I know for me when I used to share the exact same experience it's like fireworks in my veins and it's that magical thing of me too. The struggle with depression or constantly feeling separate and outside and alone and when you hear someone spark that knife of truth through your heart it's like nothing else. It's the most beautiful feeling and I've got that from you so many times.
Chris:        That's so nice. Thank you. And can I say that the use of phrases like fireworks in your veins and the knife of truth through your heart are truly flattering compliments and they are only amplified in their beauty by your Australian accent. I mean that. Americans in general I think are very enchanted by the Australian accent and I count myself among that number.
Caller:        Thank you.
Chris:        Well now we're both blushing. It's just a compliment pretty.
Caller:        Now we're both blushing.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah. Indeed. That's super nice. Well I'm sorry you've dealt with that stuff too, that sucks.
Caller:        Yeah, you know what man, I've gone through it and there's a lot of that stuff in my family, drug addiction and mental illness and all kinds of ugly stuff but I have to say through my own treatment and my own recovery with those things I'm really grateful for it. All of those things that I've lived through have armed with tools for living and to help other people and I think through service I kind of have a sense of purpose in life. Which is a kind of beautiful thing.
Chris:        Yeah, that's super nice. I remember once there was a stretch and I did not do this, I should say, I thought about, it's not ... it's going to make me sound bad that I got so into this and to not do it. There was a stretch when I was in therapy for a few years and I started to tell my shrink I think I want to drop everything and go do Habitat for Humanity and she said, she's like, that's when I know someones on the other side of things because when you want to start helping other people it's a real sign that you are pushing through your own ... you're on the tail end of your own stuff. So I think that thing you said service to others-
Caller:        Yeah, that's exactly it.
Chris:        Yeah. And then I went in the other direction and I just went and made fucking cash bro. I just went in made my own cash. I said it's not about them it's about me.
Caller:        Fucking do it.
Chris:        Yeah, the best thing I could do to help other people, have a hit podcast bro. Just messing around. I'm on the same page as you. I'm on the same page as you.
Caller:        I get it. But I think that ... maybe you didn't go and work the Habitat for Humanity but you did go and do comedy and you did those things like you're doing right now and I think we get to be of service with the gifts we're given and yours was obviously comedy and sharing your story and that is incredibly helpful, probably better than you could have ever done with Habitat for Humanity. You know what I mean?
Chris:        I mean having recently renovated two rooms in my house and screwed up every single piece of the responsibility handed to me, no one needs me building them a house. I'll make the jokes, I'll make the jokes for the hardworking people that build the houses. This is a tangent but it's made me ... I do feel like, and this has been said before, but I do feel like comedy is a weird thing and I kind of feel like in the Darwinism sense it clearly developed because weak useless men like me had to find some way that the strong people would give them meat sometimes. So I let them go out and hunt and kill everybody and let all the strong women ... like when the hunter gather days, all the strong people, the strong men went out and did what they did, the strong women did what they did and then the weaklings like me were like you guys seem tired, why don't you kick your feet up and I'll take some of the fruits and nuts that we've gathered today. Thank you for killing that viking horde and what's the deal with their boats.
Caller:        Yeah, and I'll tell you a joke about ballsacks.
Chris:        So can I ask, you brought up that you've had some dark times and that you've gone on to go into service, can I ask, you said you've been in treatment, did you want to talk about it? I'm not sure if you're just complimenting me which is much appreciate dor if you're opening the door to that conversation on your own.
Caller:        Yeah, I think we can get there organically but you know I was born to two drug addicts. Both of my parents have struggled with addiction. My mom was addicted to heroin from the time she was 14.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        And gave birth to my sister while she was still loaded so my sister was born addicted to heroin. She's been clean now for 35 years, she's been in recovery for a long time.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        My father was ... yeah. My father was clean for 28 years, he was in prison for 15 of those, my entire childhood and relapsed on meth and heroin at 74 years old. And my sister is doing a really long stint in prison right. So there's lots of this stuff in my ...
Chris:        Wow, that is ...
Caller:        I've gone through some really heavy dark depression and I think kinda of weeding through the ugliness of what that programming of that trauma does to a person.
Chris:        Yeah. You got handed ... right out of the gate you got handed some things that no one wishes on anybody and it's amazing that we're even on the phone today so that reflects your strength. I will say this too, not making a joke, there is something serendipitous about your story and this call happening in Baltimore because I think it's a city that has been very famously ravaged by some of those things and some people have brought that to light on television and it seems serendipitous. So did you ever fall into the drugs yourself?
Caller:        I did, yeah. I kinda think of my ... I'm clean four years now.
Chris:        Wow, congrats.
Caller:        And I think of my drinking, using, as kind of a sense of escapism. I think I was born with a really noisy inner and outer, I used to call it the voices as a kid. I remember having a to draw a portrait of myself when I was in [inaudible 00:13:40] the best [inaudible 00:13:45] ever and on my [inaudible 00:13:48] ...
Chris:        Oh, wait, hold on, you're breaking up just a little bit.
Caller:        ... on your shoulder.
Chris:        Uh oh. Hold on one second. Can you hear me?
Caller:        Can you hear me?
Chris:        Hold on one second. Chris and Justin is that us or is it him, do we know?
Speaker 4:        That's him.
Chris:        It might be you. I'm not sure if you're moving or if there's an area that you know has better reception and another.
Caller:        The service where I am ...
Chris:        The service where I am, dot, dot, dot. Less than 10 minutes in.
Caller:        Can you hear me now? How's this?
Chris:        We were able to hear you for most of it and we were all gripped and every single person in this room wants to know what that childhood self portrait was so if your call cuts out on us now ...
Caller:        Okay, are you ready?
Chris:        Yeah, that sounded a little better. If your call cuts out on us now it will be a historical tease for a loaded episode of Beautiful Anonymous.
Caller:        You're ready?
Chris:        Yeah, no, there you are, there you are. Welcome back, welcome back.
Caller:        Okay. I drew this portrait of myself and on my shoulder was this little army and the teacher asked me what's on your shoulder and I said it's the voices which of course terrified her and I got sent to a therapist immediately at like six years old. And one therapist said to my mom, he's not schizophrenic it's just ... being really cruel to ... Oh, shit I just said my name.
Chris:        That's okay. We'll bleep it out. The only people who know are the people in Baltimore and they're going to be cool about it. It's fine. It's fine.
Caller:        Great. Let's make sure we bleep that out.
Chris:        Yes we will.
Caller:        But I think that inner and outer is kind of common for people like you and I it sounds like and that voice says things to me like you're ugly, you're untalented and you've got no reason to be alive and it's just constantly going on and on and on. And I think that a lot of my drinking was about escaping the noise inside my head you know?
Chris:        Yeah, I get it, I get it. I had my version of it. So drinking was the road that you went down huh?
Caller:        A bit of drinking, it was sex addiction, it was whatever I could do to stop thinking about me I would do and it was normally pretty abusive to myself.
Chris:        Yeah. And I have to imagine being in the situation with your mom and your dad, do you look back ... I mean you sound ... there's so much clarity ion your voice now and there's so much passion in your voice now and it's beautiful, I have to imagine do you look back ... the thing that's breaking my heart right out of the gate is ... I think everybody will agree one of the most unforgivable things is when a kid doesn't have a chance and it sounds like you were one of those kids and that has to suck to think about as you get older and push through this stuff.
Caller:        My mom is incredibly supportive and wanted to give me the best opportunity that I could possibly have. I grew up in a pretty wealthy area, I guess, in Australia, purely from the proceeds of my father's drug dealing which made it feel really unsafe and scary but I did get a lot. I wasn't necessarily homeless as a child or anything.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Given the circumstances I probably had the best opportunity I could have. And I found the arts really young which was a perfect kind of place of solace for me and the mix of that ugliness.
Chris:        I will say in the history of this show I don't know if I've ever had a situation where there are so many things to talk about that I don't even know which direction to go in. Where would you go? There's a part of me that's like your dad relapsed at 74, what was that like? There's a part of me that wants to know how did you get out of this? There's a part of me that wants to know the fact that your mom was an addict when she had your sibling but then she was so supportive of you. That's so fascinating. There's so many fascinating things, where should we start? Also, what the fuck is up with the platypus?
Caller:        There's so many places man. I think that's the best place to start.
Chris:        Great, let's do it.
Caller:        No one knows what the fuck is up with a platypus, no one knows.
Chris:        Yeah, let's get this one out of the way before we get super heavy. Not that we haven't already. Let's come up for air. When you're in Australia and you grow up in Australia, is that a thing you see? I'll see a raccoon from time to time.
Caller:        They are everywhere.
Chris:        They're everywhere?
Caller:        Yeah, they're squirrels, they're everywhere. You can't walk down the street without seeing either a kangaroo or a platypus.
Chris:        Are you making a joke and messing with me because I'm a clearly ignorant American here? Or are they like a squirrel level of ubiquitousness?
Caller:        [static] let's go with it.
Chris:        Oh, you're going to make me wonder forever. That's fair. Here's the thing I want to start with for real. How and when did you get out of it, after a family history that sounds brutal, how were you the one that broke the cycle and congrats on doing that and knock on wood that that continues?
Caller:        I'm in a [static] how much I drank it had ...
Chris:        I got to stop you.
Caller:        ... using or lying or whatever ...
Chris:        You gotta, I'm begging you.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Wherever the three square feet are with the good reception, no matter how contemplative we get, no mater how much you want to pace around during this call, stay in the safe zone.
Caller:        Second.
Chris:        Awesome. So you were saying.
Caller:        Yeah. I think that what happened for me no mater how much I was drinking or using or, excuse me language, but fucking or lying or whatever I was doing to escape my mind it just stopped working. It was like the voices were getting noisier and the pain in my chest was getting bigger and bigger and it just didn't work anymore and I found my way into 12 step stuff and it really kinda changed my life. And then ultimately therapy and all those different things. Which I think i was looking for all along.
Chris:        That's amazing. Someone here on Twitter was just asking did you have a rock bottom moment? It sounds like what you are describing was that more it just kinda skidded and you couldn't find that adrenaline rush anymore.
Caller:        I'll tell you what, I'm nervous to kinda talk about this if it ends up online and I've already said my name so if you would bleep my name that'd be great. I'm still nervous to share this stuff publicly you know.
Chris:        Oh, 1000% we're bleeping. If you were talking about your opinion on Alvin and the Chipmunks we'd bleep your name. No worries. That's our policy. It will be bleeped I promise you that. And I'll also say this ...
Caller:        Here's the rock bottom for me ... Sorry.
Chris:        Great. But if you don't want to share it anyway you don't even have to do that, who cares. You don't have to.
Caller:        I think I want to. It's a good story. I think it's important to share this stuff sometimes.
Chris:        Great.
Caller:        For me the way it ended is I had this run of just drinking all day every day, very consciously trying to escape what was happening inside of me and it just wasn't working anymore. And so I tried to kill myself. I made a pretty decent attempt at suicide and I woke up the next morning obviously alive in a pool of my own piss and puke and blood and the second I woke up, and I've never been religious per se but I woke up and I had this sense that God had intervened, something bigger than me had intervened because if it was up to me I wouldn't be on this call with you right now. If it was my decision I wouldn't department talking to you. And so I kinda had this deep sense something bigger than me had saved me so I went straight to what you do in the city that I live in to try and find God, I went to Yoga. And I couldn't find that there.
Chris:        Well played, well played.
Caller:        Yeah. And I was really still fucked up and I didn't find God there. I'm shaking and shivering the entire time. I had sex with two people that day, not my proudest performances. I went to Barnes and Noble and got a copy of The Power of Now and be here Now by Rom Dass and I was reading some self help books. This was all in the space of a 12 hour period looking for something to save me.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        Just one last attempt. And that night at like 11:30 I'm at home again contemplating killing myself and I'm writing a letter to my mom just saying look, I love you so much but I just can't do this anymore, I've tried, I've tried and I just can't do it. I don't know what happened ... the specifics of the next part of this story, if I typed to As and backspaced or if a popup for American Airlines came up with the tail that said AA but something just came to me that said go to a meeting. And so I Googled it and there was one happening down the road from me at midnight and I thought fuck it, this is my last ditch attempt, if I don't find a solution there I'll just kill myself and I drove over there with a shaw over my head and my socks outside of my shoes so that my footsteps were quieter and I walked in and this guy at the door said welcome, we're so glad you're here. And I went inside and I just ... I heard my story and I felt like the same way I feel when I hear you talk, that maybe I wasn't so alone and that maybe I could survive this pain that I'm living through.
Chris:        Well I'm really glad you did. And I'll tell you to, the people in Baltimore are too. There's people right now saying thank you for sharing this story. There's people saying this is so relatable. There's people saying I want to acknowledge you're here today, I'm so thankful for your vulnerability and your story. So even just right now during this live taping I feel like you're connecting with people and even when this does come online I feel like you're passing that on. So thank for that. I'll also say someone is asking-
Caller:        Thanks man.
Chris:        Yeah, of course. Someone is also asking was it hot yoga? What type of yoga are we talking here?
Caller:        It was kind of more intense than hot yoga. It was like a traditional Kirtan yoga where you're chanting 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna', it's a very traditional form of yoga which people take very seriously in my city. And they're in there detoxing and crazy and falling over and spasming and crying. It was a bit embarrassing. They had on very expensive yoga attire and i was there in my cut off jeans and like a puke stained t-shirt.
Chris:        I love you so much. You're one of my favorite callers ever, I love you. Because here's why ... Here's why and it's something I identify with so much is you knew ... you're telling a story, it's sad, we can hear the emotion in your voice that it's the saddest thing and then for you to phrase it that way and say I did what you do when you need to find God, I went to yoga, is that thing of what can you do but laugh and what can you do ...
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That day sounds amazing. That day when you woke up and you just went on this desperate blitz, that was making my hair stand up on my arms. You go to yoga. You have sex with two people. You try to find God twice via that. I like that you gave that one a second shot. You didn't take a second yoga class. You said maybe the sex thing ... you go through all these different things and then it's a fucking typo that saves your life. That's something else. Thanks for telling me that. I'll never forget that as long as I live. What would you say out of all the addictions that you fell into was the one that was most ... do they all kinda push the same buttons? Was there one that you look back and feel that was more dangerous than others?
Caller:        You mean addiction wise?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Honestly I try not to get to wrapped up in the substances I was using those days because I think it's all the same and I think that my lack of being able to be present for my life is really the most dangerous part of it. It's all attached to the same thing, is me not being able to stay still in this moment and accept it. I don't think that life is my problem, it's my response to it. And that's been the thing that's been really dangerous for along time. I feel ... even today I find myself falling into dangerous patterns that aren't necessarily like going to kill me but are going to do damage. I feel sad, I should find someone to have sex with. I feel sad I get really rage-full or whatever. I think that not being able to stay present for my life is the most dangerous thing out of all of that stuff. And I just miss it. One of my greatest dreams came true a couple of years ago and I was so stressed and so anxious about what was going on in my life, I was constantly trying to get away from it so I missed it. This beautiful thing happened, this amazing lifelong dream came true, I didn't have one second of oh my God, dreams do happen. You know? Because I wasn't present for that moment which is really sad to think back on.
Chris:        This is not a theoretical what if that happened and I was to mess up? There is a moment that you regret that your emotions weren't fully there?
Caller:        I mean yeah. Since I was a kid I wanted to move to America. It was one of my first dreams. I had this picture that I drew of myself when I was like seven years old and I was holding something green and my mom said what's the green thing and I said it's a green card. I've wanted to be in this country my entire life and I got a green card two years ago, my dream came true and I missed it because I was busy being scared of the future and regretting the past that I missed what was going on which was like everything I've ever wanted.
Chris:        Yeah. That's brutal man, that's brutal.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You are saying some stuff that is actually rattling me in a way that I don't love because it's the same ... when you were saying that same thing too of you fall into these things and you replace one thing with the other and it doesn't really matter which substance or which activity did it, you're pushing the same button. I get that. People will say to me too ... that's why I always go so nuts. People will say to me oh, your comedy is like healing you. And it's like no, me needing a validation of a crowd was as unhealthy as my drinking at a certain point. The fact that I wasn't-
Caller:        Yeah, I hear that.
Chris:        ... the fact that I wasn't taking medication because I was 21, 22 years old and I could go to New York City and kill in front of a crowd and I convinced myself that I wouldn't get that I did take medication. It was such bullshit. And it's like that same thing, that same thing you're saying of we find it somewhere don't we? Until we choose not to.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Exactly, yeah.
Chris:        Someone in the crowd right now just tweeted something that I think is really beautiful that they wanted to send you in a message. It's never too late to celebrate that dream coming true. You can still celebrate you. You still have the green card. I think that's amazing. Someone else is saying-
Caller:        Yeah. And it's ...
Chris:        Oh, no, go for it.
Caller:        Sorry, what were you saying?
Chris:        No, go for ... well someone else tweeted we all want to go tot Australia which I also think is funny. Someone's response to you always wanting to come here-
Caller:        No, skip it, skip it.
Chris:        Skip it.
Caller:        Skip it.
Chris:        Oh, the charm and the ... you are peaking valleys, you're peaks and valleys. You get us sad and you make us laugh. I love it, I love it.
Caller:        Yeah, I certainly ... I did celebrate it. I was going through a major depression when I was sober, when I got my green card and I kind of missed it because of that and since then I have actually ... I had a really beautiful party to celebrate that moment and I'm doing more of those kind of things, celebrating what's going on now. I realized a little while ago, honestly two weeks ago, that I was doing so many things in my life for a future that wasn't here yet.
Caller:        Everything I do in my life is for my career in some way, shape or form and I forgot that there are things that I really enjoy doing that I've neglected to do because they're not going to further me towards that goal. Literally when I saw your Instagram post I went straight to a magic ... I was coming out of a magic store. Not because I want to be a magician but because I used to really love doing magic and doing magic tricks for people and it's a really fun thing that I could just be doing right now that's not towards any future goal but it's going to make this moment that I'm living more fun and more enjoyable. You know?
Chris:        That's beautiful and it's one of those things that it's like you set out to do it, there's a mechanism, you have to be focused just on that, you have to be focused on just executing that, you can't be worried about what happened before it or what's going to happen after it, for those 45 seconds you're doing that dumb trick the only option is to just do the dumb trick.
Caller:        I mean Chris you haven't seen the trick so let's not make judgements on good the trick is or how dumb the trick is.
Chris:        Oh my God.
Caller:        I do appreciate the sentiment though.
Chris:        You just fucking owned me in front of Baltimore bro. That's incredible. The sentiment stands.
Caller:        That is appreciated.
Chris:        I have a thing ... do you want to hear about a thing that I've literally never told anybody in my life but it's a thing, it's a thing that-
Caller:        I would love to hear that.
Chris:        ... even if when you just said there everything becomes about your career, oo boy, you called it in the beginning, we are similar in many ways because I get so caught up in it. But there's a thing I do and some of this is because my shrink sorta helped me realize it, I just have a real inability to slow down. Ina way that sounds similar to you. One of the great things about being married is my wife is always pointing out when I'm going to hard in that direction but it is so hard for me to turn it off and I also put myself in these position where everything's grassroots but that means everything's on me, I got to go, I got to go, I got to build it. I feel this responsibility, I got the TV show which is nice but that means there's like 70 who's jobs rely on me getting this thing renewed.
Chris:        The podcast, the tour. It's like nice, it's nice, it's nice, but my brain never slows down and there's a thing I've learned to do where it's like every once in a while I will find myself in a situation where I am alone and I will realize oh, this is the part of the day for me and I will put my phone away, I'll turn it off to put it on airplane mode and I will just walk around the block and get where I was supposed to go a minute later than I should have and they won't eve know why I was a minute late but that's a minute that I had that no one else had and there was no pressure on it except to walk around the block for the sake of doing so and that has kept me sane.
Caller:        Man you are speaking my language, I literally did this two days ago, exactly that thing except it was three minutes and I was doing it purely so I had three minutes to myself. That's amazing.
Chris:        And I say it in my head sometimes. This is the part of the day that's for me. We are speaking the same language except you are fortunate to speak it in a very beautiful accent.
Caller:        Thanks mate.
Chris:        Yeah, I got to say ... there's so many callers to this show I've loved. I'm going to say this, I hope this isn't awkward, there's never anymore I've regretted the anonymity more because I feel like me and you should hang out.
Caller:        I feel the same way. I felt this since I first saw your stuff years ago, thinking this guy and I would be best friends man, we could totally connect.
Chris:        I really feel like we would be. Should we go over some of our hobbies and interests? Let's go over some of our hobbies and interests and see if we'd be best friends. How do you feel about professional wrestling?
Caller:        I was obsessed when I was a kid. It's not as big in Australia but I used to learn watching it when it was still WWF, I was completely obsessed and my entire bedroom become like a cage match with me throwing myself off of walls. I'm a big fan.
Chris:        Okay. I know my top five all time. Do you want to name your top five all time and we'll see if any of them cross over? Maybe I can even whisper them-
Caller:        They're not going to cross over because my knowledge ends at the Rock, that was my guy.
Chris:        Yeah but I was born in 1980, I grew up with all the stuff before that.
Caller:        It's not going to link up. My wrestling knowledge I hope doesn't break the bromance that is kinda growing here ends at the Rock.
Chris:        That's okay. My top five for the record, Ric Flair, the Nature Boy, whoa. Jake the Snake Roberts, Rowdy Roddy Pipper, Million Dollar Man, Ted DiBiase, I like the bad guys and then outlier that I will stand by, the great Mutoh. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, thank you ladies and gentlemen. Okay, so we both like wrestling. We danced around it. I will tell you the crowd is giggling because they're watching me get nervous hoping that you like me. What's your bromance test? We're doing a bromance test. What's your next link in the bromance test?
Caller:        Okay. How do you feel about sci-fi?
Chris:        I love sci-fi so much. When I was in high school ...
Caller:        Sorry. How do you feel about Jodie Foster's Contact?
Chris:        Jodie Foster's Contact, I'll tell you, I've watched it. I'm not going to lie, it didn't leave too much of a long lasting impact.
Caller:        The second you get off stage you're going to whatever hotel room you're staying in and watching it again.
Chris:        Yeah, okay.
Caller:        This is make or break for you and me man, you've got to like that movie for this to be able to work out.
Chris:        Okay. I'll give it a fair shot. I'll really watch it with a open mind.
Caller:        It is a masterpiece.
Chris:        It's a masterpiece, yeah. I mean I was young when I saw it. Sometimes you go back and revisit things and see things you didn't see before. Jodie Foster I think she's really phenomenal. I'm surprised I didn't like it the first time. What's your all-time favorite video game? I'm not much of a gamer but what's your all-time favorite?
Caller:        Yeah, I'm not a gamer, I never have been. I was much more into books as a kid. Video games was never my thing and I remember getting, I think it was a Nintendo 64 as a kid just to say that I had one, I saved up for it and everything and I didn't play it one time, I just had it there as a prop for any friend who came over could say oh, that's my gaming console when I'm playing games but I never played it once, it's not my thing.
Chris:        Oh my God, we are so similar.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That's my gaming console. Okay, you're turning the bromance test. To be fair other acceptable answers would have been Mike Tyson's Punchout and Golden Eye.
Caller:        Oh, Golden Eye was the only one that I had, never played it but it lived inside of the slot so I think that links up.
Chris:        That's cool. Okay, your turn in the bromance test, your turn in the bromance test.
Caller:        It's tricky because I feel like we're doing so well. I'm honestly quite nervous to ask you a question that you don't agree with me on.
Chris:        Yeah, I'm nervous-
Caller:        Like where does that leave you and me?
Chris:        I'm nervous too for the same exact reason.
Caller:        I think we have to leave it then. I think we have to agree that we've got enough, that the groundwork is laid, this is beautiful ,to go upon and let's move on from the bromance, I think we have enough information.
Chris:        Yes, yes, we're friends. We're friends, yes. I made a friend. I made a friend. Someone on Twitter did tell me they are also disappointed with me. They said dude, I remember where I was and who I saw Contact with, disappointing. People are asking if they can hang out with us.
Caller:        [crosstalk 00:40:07] ...
Chris:        I like that. People are saying three minutes he's got you one up, take more time for yourself Chris. I like that. Other people pointing out that we ... someone is saying we are watching you fall in love again in Baltimore. If you could see my body language or my facial reaction caller, caller you'd be very, very, impressed. Someone else also just said I think instead of just falling in love with this caller just like me. Someone said there's an emo balloon behind you. I don't know what that means unfortunately. Oh, there it is. Oh yeah, an emo night balloon wearing a punk bar.
Caller:        I almost turned around and looked behind me. There is no balloon here.
Chris:        There isn't. So you live on the east coast of America or the west coast of America?
Caller:        On the west coast. I'm so sorry. When I moved to America the first time I was in New York City so I was east coast, I came out here for work.
Chris:        We coulda walked past each other on the street while both of us were taking our private strolls around the block and we never even knew it.
Caller:        Yeah. Never even knew it.
Chris:        Look at that. So we have 23 minutes left. This one's flying by, wow.
Caller:        That's crazy.
Chris:        I really love your philosophy, how you got to where you're at, the way you want to spread it. Even though you're saying you're still in the middle of some tough times, really incredible and I'm glad that we could become friends. I don't know. Here's the thing that I want to know more about if that's okay. You said you kinda lived high on the hog because your ... so your dad was like a drug dealer and it sounds like he was pretty high up in the chain huh?
Caller:        Yeah, I mean he was. He was ultimately caught importing 150 million dollars worth of narcotics into Australia. That's kinda what he went down for in the end.
Chris:        Yeah. That'll do it. Wow.
Caller:        Kind of a big deal.
Chris:        You were surrounded by mayhem from day one.
Caller:        Yeah, and it's really funny Chris, I only realized that recently. You live through whatever experiences you live through as a child and just count them as normal and in the past couple of years I've been able to open up to people and share what my life was like. They're like that's fucking crazy and I never knew that perhaps was a bit of a chaotic and scary way to grow up, you know?
Chris:        Yeah. Kids manage to normalize so much, right? And you certainly had to to keep going.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I mean you said your dad relapsed. You mentioned that your mom's been very supportive. What is your relationship with your parents like now?
Caller:        Well my mother and father, it was kind of a fling that ended up in me so it wasn't like they were ever married or anything. My mom has been clean all my life and then some and my father was dealing drugs when he was sober as well and got arrested. I think he had 15 years sober by the time he went to prison for dealing drugs. Yeah. My mom and I are very, very close. I love her very much. Much more so since I kind of found my way into therapy and different forms of recovery from those kinda things. My father and I had a very difficult relationship. I tend to think of him as a pretty malevolent kinda guy, pretty horrible person. And I think my greatest fear before was becoming my father, you know? He was abusive and he would lie and he'd cheat and he'd steal and my greatest fear was becoming like him and I think in the end of my drinking career what scared me the most was I was looking a lot like him in my behavior. And then after I kind of got a year sober he relapsed after 28 years and was having heart attacks because meth is not good for you when you're 74 years old. It's not good for you ever but especially not when you're 74 years old.
Chris:        They should put that on the package.
Caller:        Yeah, I think it's important. Drugs are bad, drugs are bad, don't do them ever. Or do them but just don't abuse them. Yeah. He relapsed when I got one year sober and it was an incredibly confronting thing because I had spent my entire life I guess hating him. He's a pretty ugly kinda guy and a lot of my identity I think was wrapped up in this guy fucked me over. And so a big part of my sobriety has been finding ... cultivating love and compassion and forgiveness which has meant nothing but freedom for me and it's been a pretty difficult but also beautiful process, I guess, to not have to carry that stuff on anymore.
Chris:        Yeah, that's incredible. That's incredible. For somebody who's dealt with as much as you have and came as close as you did you got such a good head on your shoulders, it is impressive. Your ability to verbalize this stuff ... yeah. I mean your ability to verbalize this stuff in such a clear way means you've ... it just shows you've thought about it so backwards and forwards and it's so cool. Someone on Twitter did just tweet that this is the most beautiful thing they've witnessed since Jodie Foster's performance in Contact. So you know ...
Caller:        That is an honor that I will never live up to. I appreciate the idea and the thought but that is quite honestly offensive to Jodie Foster and Robert Zemeckis who directed that masterpiece.
Chris:        Okay, fair. Someone is saying in our bromance test that I did have a missed opportunity. How do you feel about the Smith's and Morrissey?
Caller:        I love the Smith's, I love the Smith's and I was actually playing a cover of Panic on the Streets of London yesterday with a friend of mine. I'm going to tweet it at you or have someone tweet it at you anonymously so you can hear it. I think it's quite good.
Chris:        I would love that. I'm in a Smith's cover band myself, we're called Mr. Shankley and the Frankley's.
Caller:        That's amazing. Is that real?
Chris:        It is yeah. We've played three shows. It started as a joke but now people keep trying to book us and a record label just offered to put out a record and I don't know if I should take them up on it.
Caller:        That's amazing.
Chris:        What's your favorite Smith song? And I know they change all the time, currently?
Caller:        Currently right now is Panic because I was playing it yesterday. I just think that song is so good, it's the epitome of Morrissey and how great his voice can be. That, How Soon is Now, I think kind of remain in the top five for me.
Chris:        Yeah. I've recently gotten very into... Lately for some reason after a lifetime of kind of coming and going on it I've gotten very into That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore.
Caller:        It's good, it's good.
Chris:        It is because it's about not laughing at people who don't have it as good as you and I think that that's a really nice sentiment.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Man, why is this podcast anonymous?
Caller:        Chris I wish we had more time, there so many other stories that I feel like if I was to even mention like the headline of you'd want to unwrap them but there's not enough time, you know ... There's so many other things that I think you and I would connect on.
Chris:        Do you want to be like a brutal tease to this Baltimore crowd and just list some of those headlines just so we all know ... because we only have 16 minutes left, what are some pf the headlines that we probably won't have time to get into that we'll all just have to wonder?
Caller:        Okay, we'll start with this. Childhood TV star gets married to a person he's known for three and a half weeks, divorced five months later. Oh, there's so many more Chris. What else? Sister's incarceration. There's some happy fun ones, there's some darker ones, there's some really sad ones, really inspiring ones. There's so much to talk about Chris.
Chris:        With the amount you've managed to make the dark ones happy and fun I can't imagine how happy and fun a happy and fun one would be. You got big laughs off a story about trying to kill yourself. Give us one happy and fun one. I think this crowd and I think I personally would love to hear a happy and fun one just because I think we all feel like you deserve the happy and fun ones and we want to live one of those with you.
Caller:        Okay, okay. On second thought I'm not sure how happy and fun they are, that was better... If we are really similar people the happy fun one will inadvertently disturb people more than the suicide attempt one.
Caller:        Yeah, okay. I was doing some work at the Cannes Film Festival on the South of France, I know how ridiculous that sounds, I apologize. But I was out there on a job and I was staying in this apartment with a bunch of European models and actresses and actors and there WhatsApp a whole bunch of people and there was this one day I had a meeting in the afternoon and I was kind of nervous and hungry, that's what I to when I'm nervous, I tend to eat. And so I was going to the fridge and I found this bar of chocolate and it looked like something you'd find in a gift bag at one of those fancy events so I eat that, I eat two of those and I have some bread.
Caller:        So I'm walking down, I still got like an hour so I sit in the coffee shop and I'm having a coffee by myself and I'm sitting there reading the menu and the next thing I know is my face is attached to the menu and I peel myself off of it like what the fuck is going on and I look around and the buildings are getting really big and really small and really big and really small and it's getting really crazy and psychedelic. I got no idea what's going on and I could've realized that somehow I've induced some kind of trip and made myself like crazy high, like I was tripping and I started laughing to myself and I look around and realize that everyone in the coffee shop is staring at me with these red eyes and I'm like this is too fucking weird for me.
Caller:        So I walk up to the counter to pay for my coffee and the woman looks back at me and says in a perfect American accent you haven't ordered a coffee sir which freaks me the fuck out and I'm running down the street. I'm texting my girlfriend at the time saying there's crazy inside of me, it is consuming me, I don't know what's going on. Long story short the chocolate that I ate was laced with acid, mushrooms and molly and I'd taken like eight times more than the recommended dose so I was like tripping, seeing anomalies for like probably a week and a half. It was the most horrifying experience of my life. And also hilarious.
Chris:        Thank you for the happy fun one.
Caller:        Yeah you're welcome.
Chris:        We are meant to be friends if your happy fun one ends with the sentence it was the most horrifying experience of my life. I mean that's super scary especially for someone who's an addict. That's panic inducing.
Caller:        Oh it was fine. I wasn't sober at the point so it was kind of in the end I thought great, I'm just high now, this is wonderful and didn't have to pay for it.
Chris:        Yeah. Hey, I want to know, just out of my own personal curiosity, this has been a quite inspiring call and I mean that so genuinely but just as someone thinking ... like you're putting your own story out there in the world and saying I got four years, I went through all this stuff, and maybe saying it could help some other people, I think that's beautiful. I do want to, just as someone who's really caring about you right now, what kind of support system do you have now? Do you have people around who you lean on?
Caller:        I do absolutely. All of the people that I live with have all kind of been through similar experiences. I go and see a therapist when I can afford it. I do all the things. I kind of ritualized my life so it's kind of pretty balanced and level headed and I have all the structures in place that I know that I need to be able to stay in a place that feels like I've got no reason to escape from my life anymore. You know?
Chris:        Yeah. You had mentioned when you can afford it. It did remind me ... someone asked a question I thought was pretty interesting. How do ... do you feel like being an addict or the way that programs are built to deal with addiction, are they different in America and Australia, is it easier here, harder here, similar?
Caller:        This is like a whole other conversation but I really feel like, especially for drug addiction, and there are people who have had it far worse than I did with that stuff, I didn't end up on the streets like some people do but it really makes me sad and I think people in Baltimore understand this, there's this really ugly business structure around people needing recovery from addiction where people are actually making money off of people who are really desperate. Depending on their insurance policies and there's all kinds of really icky ugly stuff that goes on. In Australia if you need treatment for drug addiction there's waiting lists but it's covered by the government because it's universal healthcare whereas over there's companies who are getting really ... it's like a 35 billion dollar industry, the rehab industry which I think is kinda sad and a bit scary for the people who are dying because they don't have insurance.
Chris:        Yeah, i agree. Everybody who listens to this show knows I'm a New Yorker and I'm a liberal but that's one of those ones where it's like why exactly is this even up for debate if people need to die on the streets in pain. I don't get it. I don't get that one.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I'm not trying to take some political stance but responding like you said, it is nuts. One of the things that I find people are always shocked by when I leave America, people always ask me why do you guys have commercials for medications and then you think about that for 10 seconds and you're like oh yeah, that's fucked man. The doctor should tell you what to take because it's the best thing to take. Somebody shouldn't be selling that to you like it's a bottle of Mr. Clean, that's a totally different thing man.
Caller:        I know. It kind of like trickles down to all different things. I want to say that I love this country and I respect it with all of my heart, I wanted to be here my entire life but there are things in the system that just aren't working. For example, in Australia it's universal healthcare so if you get sick the government will pay for it basically. And the best embodiment of that is that cigarettes in Australia cost about $39 a packet because if you get sick with cancer the government's going to be paying for it so they tax them really high. Now cigarettes in America are really cheap because people end up getting kind of wealthy if your sick which is a really sad and scary thing to think about I think.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah it is. I want to ask you, and again, we're getting into something intense, I don't want to just distract it with something silly but you might be able to help me solve a problem or just a thing that I've wondered about ... Beautiful Anonymous, we got the Facebook group Beautiful Anonymous and I've asked people where should I go on the tour and then people tell me what cities to go to, that's how I planned this tour. That's how I wound up in Baltimore. A lot of people here said they would come so yeah, I'll go there, it's nice.
Chris:        That being said there's a lot of people ... it seems like there's a lot of people who listen to the show in Australia and I think that's so rad, I've always wanted to go. I'm really scheming on how to get to an Australian tour but there's one consistent thing I've noticed, that people from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, they're like yeah, come here, it'll be rad, we'll all come, yeah. And people from some place called Perth always go, come to Australia but I know you won't come to Perth anyway. Anyone who mentions Perth seems to mention it as this place that just constantly gets skipped and ignored.
Caller:        That's kind of how it's thought of generally.
Chris:        Are you from Perth?
Caller:        I'm actually not, no. I've got friends who are but I've actually never been to Perth. I hear it's gorgeous but it's kind of a little bit far out.
Chris:        Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud on the podcast and whoever has to organize my next tour is going to be so mad, I'm going to Perth baby, I'm going to Perth. I know we don't have the time to totally get into it but the fact that you said your mom gave birth to your sister, your sister was addicted, you've indicted your sister might not be doing great, how's she doing?
Caller:        It's been a struggle man. She was born addicted and she went through all kinds of trauma, you know? Because my mom was still loaded when she was a child so she was in and out of foster care and lived through a whole bunch of sexual abuse and all kinds of ugly stuff and as a result she ended up really struggling as an adult and she's incarcerated and she'll be in there for ... she ended up getting a really hefty sentence and she's not getting out anytime soon. But I've got to say ... and this is what I think but I think everything ... I don't know if this is the right viewpoint because I struggle with this sometimes, everything happens for a reason, maybe, or, everything happens given a reason.
Caller:        And I think that what she's done with the experience ... if she's out on the streets she's using heroin, there no two ways about it, she is loaded, she's doing the wrong thing. And this was kind of the only way it could end for her it seems like because she wasn't able to stay clean and as a result she's actually clean for the first time in there. And you can use drugs in prison if you want but she's clean and she's helping people and she's finally looking at stuff that she kind of probably wouldn't have been able to if she had been using instead, on the streets. So she's doing the best she possibly can with what she's got which is really beautiful. I love her so much and I'm really proud of her even given the circumstances.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah. Just hearing that that sounds like making the best of a horrible thing. We've got about five minutes left. We've got about five minutes. Left. You've blown my mind. I want to thank you for that. I think this is one of the most heart wrenching and yet somehow also one of the most funny episodes we've ever had and I don't know how you pulled off both but thank you for it. Scott, we've got five minutes-
Caller:        Thank you so much. I've tried calling so many times. Every time I see the post come up I like run to find a pen somewhere. I will drop whatever I'm doing. I was at work the other day and dropped everything to run and someone was like what the fuck are you doing? I was like Chris is waiting for me.
Chris:        So you run to find a pen to write it down, the number?
Caller:        To write down the number, yeah.
Chris:        You should just save it in your phone bro.
Caller:        That would make so much more sense.
Chris:        Well I'm glad you never got through those times because I feel like this one was meant for this live thread. I feel like it was meant for this city and these people. And you just said everything for reason, I think is good example of that. Hey, did you like comic books growing up?
Caller:        I did. I was never big into superheroes but I was big into graphic novels. I'm quite a bit younger than you but the things that I was obsessed with were things like Why The Last Man, and Ex Machina things like that which aren't necessarily superhero novels but you know ...
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        ... graphic novels and pretty badass.
Chris:        You got some cheers, I will say, bringing up Indie graphic novels at a punk bar in Baltimore is a good way to endear yourself to the crowd.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        If there's any room in any town that's going to clap for Why The Last Man it's the Auto Bar on a Sunday afternoon.
Caller:        I feel like you have to check it out. There was this one that i loved which I don't think it's easy to get anymore but it was by this guy Kevin Wasanga... and there's a novel called Gangef, G-A-N-G-E-F, that I think you would love. I feel like we're very similar, I think this would appeal to your sensibilities in a big way.
Chris:        I'll look that one up. That sounds really good.
Caller:        Yeah, I thin you'll enjoy it.
Chris:        You gave me a recommendation of a graphic novel, can I give you a recommendation of a superhero run?
Caller:        Please.
Chris:        So I never liked Thor as a kid, I always thought he was a little cheesy but I've been hearing that there was a really great run of Thor that happened right before I started reading comic books but I wasn't going to go track down the back issues of a series that I didn't really love the current version of but now Marvel has this Marvel unlimited app and it's really great and I can go back and read all the old stuff and there's a guy, his name is Walt Simonson and he wrote this run on Thor and it's really ... there's a guy named Betta Ray Bill and I saw pictures of him when I was a kid and I was like that looks like the lamest shit I literally have ever seen and I just went back and read Walt Simonson's run on Thor and I'm like yo, Betta Ray Bill is my favorite superhero ever. And there's one part, sorry for the spoilers, Thor turns into a frog and I know the sentence Thor turns into a frog sounds like the biggest waste of your time but it's like it just kinda shows everything that's good about Thor.
Caller:        Honestly dude, you're my favorite friend. All my friends in this city are so cool and it's so great to be able to nerd out with someone, thank you for giving me that...
Chris:        Dude, I'm going to tell you something, no offense to my other friends but you're one of my better friends.
Caller:        That sounds amazing.
Chris:        Yeah. I feel like most of my friends either don't understand what I do or they also do what I do and that inherently creates this weird like weariness, I don't know, that's coming out wrong but I think you know what I mean. I just feel like our friendship is just ...
Caller:        Yeah, I get it.
Chris:        ... it is what it is for the sake of being what it is.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah, it's basically our.
Chris:        The phone's going to hang up in a minute and a half and I don't want it to.
Caller:        Should we close this out singing a New England?
Chris:        Yeah I would do that. This will mark the second time I have sung Billy Bragg's New England on Beautiful Anonymous but I would love that. Okay.
Caller:        Oh no.
Chris:        That's okay.
Caller:        Are you sure?
Chris:        Yeah man. People don't mind hearing the best song of all time again.
Caller:        Okay. Let's close it out with this. How many seconds do we have?
Chris:        47.
Caller:        Seven seconds?
Chris:        45. 40.
Caller:        Okay, here we go, thank you Chris, I love you, it's been so great to talk to you, let's go.
Chris:        I love you, thank you for sharing your story.
Caller:        One, two, three, four.
Chris:        I was 21 years ... Oh no.
Caller:        I was 21 years when I wrote this song.
Chris:        I'm 22 now but I won't be for long. People asked me when will I grow up to to be a man but all the girls are already pushing prams ... I loved you then as I love you still though I put you on a ped ...
Caller:        Though I put you on a pedestal, they put you on the pill ...
Chris:        I don't feel bad about letting you go, I just feel sad about letting you know. I don't want to change ...
Speaker 4:        Abra-fucking-cadabra Chris.
Chris:        Thank you. Wow. For anyone who couldn't hear how that call ended, it ended with Heath yelling the words abra-ca-fucking-dabra. Calling back to the magic, well done.
