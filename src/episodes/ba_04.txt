Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Hi.
Caller:        Is this Chris Gethard?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        No way.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        No way.
Chris:        Yes way. Me.
Caller:        That's too crazy.
Chris:        It's funny. That's so nice that people say that, but from my perspective, it's not that ... I'm just a guy.
Caller:        No. I just listen to you a lot, so you're a little bigger than that. I have had a lot of conversations with you in my head.
Chris:        That's nice. You want to hear what ...
Caller:        Well, you caught me at quite the pivotal moment in my life.
Chris:        Really?
Caller:        I'm actually at the hospital, a children's hospital, waiting. I got here early because of traffic and I'm waiting to meet with my daughter's oncologist about her scan that she had last night.
Chris:        Oh wow.
Caller:        Kind of nervous and anxious.
Chris:        Yeah. I can imagine. I've never met you and I'm nervous and anxious, as well. So you're in a waiting room right now?
Caller:        Yeah. We are just sitting outside waiting.
Chris:        You and your family? Is your daughter there?
Caller:        My husband took me. No we didn't bring her to this one. This is actually the first time we didn't bring her along because it's early and she is asleep. And there's not much ... They didn't need to check her. They just needed to give us the news.
Chris:        I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry you're dealing with that. Can't imagine.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. It's been quite the journey. It's not an easy thing and waiting to find out about these scans is probably the hardest part. So you can be a therapist for me for the next however long.
Chris:        I can't be a therapist by a long shot, but I ...
Caller:        Well you can distract me how about?
Chris:        I can distract you. I can be a shoulder for you to lean on. I'm very happy to step in and do that. And I can try to distract you and as a comedian, I can try to look for a couple of laughs, although I can't imagine a call where that would maybe be less appropriate, but that's always my instinct.
Caller:        No. It is appropriate. We actually, we've been doing this since August 2015. So it's just part of our lives and we've learned to find joy in the journey and find a laugh along the way. And your podcast has helped for sure.
Chris:        Well that's super nice to hear.
Caller:        It's true. And I'll be honest, I was listening to it last night because I was driving home from the scan that she had last night. So it kept me entertained for the hour drive home.
Chris:        Swingers episode?
Caller:        Oh, thank you. (to someone in the waiting room)
Chris:        Put the swingers on after a rough night, a tough night?
Caller:        Your birthday episode last night. Happy birthday.
Chris:        Oh. Thanks. Yes.
Caller:        I don't know what ... It was just when I listened to it. It might have aired previously.
Chris:        Yeah, back in May. But that's okay. So this has been going on for two full years. So your daughter first got diagnosed two years ago?
Caller:        Almost yeah. In August it'll be two years that she was diagnosed.
Chris:        Wow. And how old is your kid?
Caller:        She is 10 now, so she was 8 when she was diagnosed and did 10 months of really intense treatment and then had six glorious months where we got to take a breather and then we're back at it in December, or yeah December, end of December 2016. It's back.
Chris:        And can I ask what the diagnosis was?
Caller:        Yeah. I'm sure you haven't heard of it. It's called rhabdomyosarcoma. It's one of those rare soft tissue tumors in her head. Not in her brain, but in her head, so sinuses. Yeah. We first found out because she had paralysis on the right side of her face, but all of that came back and she's had a lot. She really has had more good days than bad days and we really just focus on those thankfully.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        To help us make it through.
Chris:        That's brutal.
Caller:        Yeah. It is really, really hard. Yep. Definitely. But really cool, too. It's helped us to find this whole community of love and goodness that has just, you know, shown us so much love. Yesterday we were actually, we got to meet 12 of the top high school football stars, high school football quarterbacks and they gave her lots of attention and love and that was really sweet.
Chris:        That's cool.
Caller:        Then we just went to Spain a couple of months ago through this organization that likes to do adventure therapy for kids in her situations and that was amazing. I mean just so many amazing opportunities and memories that we've had. So there's a lot of good in this world for sure.
Chris:        I've never thought about that. Yeah. It must be, if there's any small silver lining, it must be nice that you get to see, you know, good-hearted people at their best. That must be a nice thing.
Caller:        Absolutely. I mean I, yeah. I can fill the entire hour with story after story of ways people ... I won't, but I could. I mean that's how amazing. And it's so nice with all of the crap that goes on in the world and all the awful stuff that we see and hear. Daily I get to see someone reach out to us, total strangers. All the time, total strangers reach out to us in love. And in fact I have to tell you, my daughter the very first week we were in the hospital, there's this little 8-year-old had this big list on the whiteboard of all the things that she had to go through that week because when they first get diagnosed, they have to get all kinds of tests done to them.
Caller:        And she had this big list and also on the whiteboard, people had written notes, we love Holly and you know, get better, just little cute notes on it. And then she wrote totally at a time I didn't even know. I don't even know when she did it, but I looked over at one point and she'd written love is everywhere on the board. And that's just become our mantra and helped us. I mean she writes it everywhere and people, it's just ... In fact, her elementary school made it big along the fence, tied these pink ribbons and says love is everywhere. So it's really amazing, the community support and love.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        So it's not all bad. [laughs] hard, but not all bad.
Chris:        I'm going to say doing this show for well over a year, I haven't cried yet and this one's going to get me. I can feel it already. I can feel it already. Love is everywhere is already gonna get me.
Caller:        Yeah. There's a lot of good in this world and it's good to remember that.
Chris:        Sure it is. Sure it is, especially as we spend all our time fighting on Facebook now and getting mad about everybody else's opinions and politics. And it's nice to remember at the end of the day humans do want to help each other when you're in times of need.
Caller:        Yes. And you know, I just don't even have the energy for all of that kind of crap because I can barely focus on what I'm dealing with. And it's good a lot of times. It's nice not to have to be involved in so much of that stuff and just focus on what good you can.
Chris:        Yeah. That's a really beautiful reminder to a lot of us, I'm sure, myself included.
Caller:        True. It's true.
Chris:        I've been caught up ...
Caller:        It's a real thing.
Chris:        I've been caught up lately in a lot of things that do not matter as much as trying to do good and tell the people I love, I love them. And it's a good reminder for me.
Caller:        Yeah. It's been good. It just helps me to keep focused on, at least in my own life, what matters and where I need to put my energies.
Chris:        Yeah. I also have to imagine, we've ... Here's a thought I have and I wonder if, because I have not been through anything close to what you're dealing with and my heart does bleed for you and goes out to you.
Caller:        Thank you.
Chris:        Here's the thing I wonder is there must be something to be said for you must know, you must have learned more about your daughter than most people do by the age of 8, by the age of 10. You know what I mean? You must know ...
Caller:        Oh absolutely, absolutely. You know, actually, I have five children. So she's number four out of five kids. So that's a whole, that's a lot, too, just dealing with all that. But it's been interesting, just the different relationship I have with her and the different connection I have with her. I mean, I love them all, obviously, and they all are important to me.
Chris:        Of course.
Caller:        But it's different for sure. There's no denying watching someone go through what she's gone through and seeing her strength and her ... And plus, we're so connected. We're just together always and I'm always helping her with all the different things that she needs. And so yeah, just watching her. I mean last night ... And I'll try and keep it together, this episode, but no guarantees. I'm pretty emotional today.
Chris:        Me, too. Same caveat. Sharing that one together.
Caller:        So we show up at the hospital, she throws up in the hallway as we're walking into the MRI. The person that's putting her ... She has a port. That's where they access her for everything they do. So they were trying to access ... It was someone that just, I don't know that she'd ever even accessed a port before, a child's port, and clearly kind of didn't know what she was doing. It was so frustrating. And trying to get it in and get in and kind of pushed around. Just kind of hurt her and then we had to lay there forever so she could call someone else to do it.
Caller:        And they couldn't put her on the machine she's used to being on. I mean, she's had at least 10-12 MRIs and always on the same machine. And they couldn't get her on that machine, which meant she couldn't, you know, watch the movies that she normally would be able to and it took even longer. So it's 45 minutes in this. She's strapped and awake. She does them all without sedation. So her head is kind of locked in and totally trapped in this machine, this super loud machine for 45 minutes. I mean, too much for a little 10-year-old to go through. And she just comes skipping out of there after it's over and we go to dinner and we laugh and play and she acts like it was nothing. It's just absolutely amazing what kids are capable. She's my hero. She's amazing.
Chris:        Yeah. That's ... She doesn't even realize how tough she is.
Caller:        No. She doesn't know. I tell her all the time, but I don't think she gets it. She doesn't get it.
Chris:        And the port, when you say port ...
Caller:        Which is also kind of a beautiful thing. Yeah.
Chris:        A port is they set up ... So they set up an access point that's semi-permanent so that they don't have to keep making it invasive?
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Right. Yeah. So no IV ever.
Chris:        And is that in her chest?
Caller:        In her chest.
Chris:        In her chest. Okay. In her chest.
Caller:        Uh-huh (affirmative). So it just goes into one of the arteries. It's more of a direct line. So yeah. It just makes it so that she doesn't have to get IVs ever.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        And she ... Yeah. Because she is being poked on a regular basis. That's just part of who she is.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah. We're here almost every week in the hospital.
Chris:        Now your other kids. Here's a question I wonder about because I'm sure, I mean these, the four other kids, this is also a massive thing in their life and they have to watch their sister ...
Caller:        Totally.
Chris:        Are there moments ... There must be moments of pure joy and support. Are there any moments where the other kids are like, "Pay attention to me?" And it's just like, "Hey, I get it, but you don't have a port in your chest kid." There must be some moments, right?
Caller:        Yeah. No. Absolutely. So we have ... She's number four and then number five, I thought life was hard when number five was born because he threw us for ... I mean, clearly, the first four must not have been that hard because we were up for having a fifth child, but he put a stop to it real quick because he is just a handful and has been since birth. He just is a harder kid and it's just kind of a little bit wild. And so yes, definitely. That has been super hard for him.
Caller:        And she got ... They have these co-organizations that help the kids out and she has what they call a chemo pal that comes and plays games with her when she gets chemo and brings her things. And so she was getting Legos all the time and he loves Legos. And it was the end of the world for him. I don't think he has any sympathy for her. I'm pretty sure he doesn't. He's just mad at her most of the time because she does get all this attention. So we have to be really careful with him that we show him the love that he needs and attention.
Caller:        It was tricky because she got diagnosed right when he was going into kindergarten. And he is kind of more of a mama's boy. He didn't want to go to school. She didn't have to go to school, but he had to go to school. And then sometimes she did have to go, but if she was sick, she didn't. And so then he would want to be sick all the time. It was just his ...
Chris:        Oh wow. And how old is he now?
Caller:        Yeah. It is great when he can [laughs]. He is now 7.
Chris:        Seven.
Caller:        so he just finished first grade.
Chris:        So he's the youngest kid. He wants all the rights that come with being the youngest of five. He wants to be the baby of the family.
Caller:        He wants the rights, but I do have to ask him all the time, "Do you want to have chemo?" But I totally understand that he doesn’t get it. He just can't. He's too little to get it and he's too, he's a pretty self-absorbed little kid anyways. Her sister that's older is the sweetest, most ... She writes songs about how we're all in this together and we're there for you. I mean she just melts my heart. She has this little song she played on her ukulele and so sweet. She's just cheerful and totally understands. And then I have two high schoolers and they get it. They're not ... I don't think they're jealous. Who knows?
Chris:        It's just that younger one.
Caller:        Yeah. It totally throws the dynamic off on the whole ...
Chris:        It's that younger one who is a real pain in the ass. That little guy is just a pain in that ass.
Caller:        The younger one. Oh my gosh. That kid. That kid. You just have no idea. He's one of a kind.
Chris:        There must be times where you're looking him in the eye and just doing everything you can to not say out loud the things that are in your head.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. He's a little stinker. Love him. Love him. I do. He's super entertaining for sure. He keeps us on our toes. But yeah, he ... A tricky one that kid.
Chris:        Yeah. For sure. For sure. But he's also one ...
Caller:        It's been interesting trying to figure out ...
Chris:        But he's also one who in 15 years ... I bet he's the one who in 15 years is going to sit down at your kitchen table with you and be like, "Hey, so let's talk about this. I owe you an apology. Can we laugh about all this?"
Caller:        I have hope because I just have to have hope. I think he's one of those kids, he's going to go one way or another and it's going to be extreme one way or another. So we're just trying super hard to keep him on the right path and keep him, you know, doing the right ... He really .... Yeah. He's intense. He's intense.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        There is ... He's got a little violence in him, just in that kind of real ... He's intense. But I think he could be really intense in a good way if we can keep him that direction. So we're working real hard on it.
Chris:        Yeah. If there's one thing that ...
Caller:        As much as we can.
Chris:        Anyone listening, if there's one thing everybody agrees on is that you are a good and attentive mom. Nobody's doubting that.
Caller:        Well. They don't have to see the... every moment so we can think that. I've had my moments for sure. But yeah, we're doing our best with that boy.
Chris:        I have a question. It's a little heartbreaking, but it's just on my mind.
Caller:        Yes. No that's all right. You really can ask anything at all, so don't hesitate.
Chris:        Of course. Yeah. I'm not trying to be over apologetic, but I'd be a monster if I was just like, "I'll just say whatever I want and never check in with you."
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's fine.
Chris:        But when you're a 10-year-old kid, so much of the dialogue is like, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yep. Yeah. It breaks my heart, honestly, I ... This is so little and so dumb, but just yesterday, she ... Her sister is getting braces on July 18th and is super excited about it, kind of a big deal, her older sister. And she, the 10-year-old, has, she needs braces and we probably could start them now, but we can't. And so yesterday she said to her, "I have to wait until I'm in high school before I can get braces."
Caller:        And just, I mean it's just a stab in the heart when she says things like that because her chances are not very high that she's going to make it. And so you know, I don't know that she'll ever make it. And I know braces don't... we shouldn't care about braces, but little things like that, it breaks my heart. But that among a million other things that she probably will never experience.
Caller:        So we live in the moment. There's nothing else, just try to take one day at a time and find the beauty in that day. And it's amazing when you do that how much beauty and good you can find around here. So yeah, it's heartbreaking.
Chris:        Yeah. It really is. You don't think of it. Most kids, that's the nerdy stretch of your life. That's brace face. You don't think of that as something you sit and pray for.
Caller:        No, because that's what we want ... I mean that's what's so crazy is things like that. But we want her to experience all of it, the bad and the good and yeah.
Chris:        Yeah. And when you say the chances aren't good, are doctors giving you guys timelines and stuff like that?
Caller:        Yeah. So with her type of cancer, when it comes back, I really don't think there's a current cure for it. They don't have something figured out when it does come back. So then they put them on trials and then you just never know with your trial if it's going to be the one. And of course, we hope. I mean we know, we're not dumb and we're not ... We know what could happen, but ...
Chris:        So trial meaning ...
Caller:        Yeah, definitely. We ...
Chris:        There's new drugs and this is so rare ...
Caller:        So this one ... Uh-huh (affirmative).
Chris:        ... they're like, "We'll just throw a Hail Mary pass on every kid that has this ..."
Caller:        Totally.
Chris:        "... and just pray that this helps."
Caller:        Yep.
Chris:        Oh my God.
Caller:        Yeah. I mean it's pretty fascinating. It's fascinating. If it wasn't my daughter, I'd be ... I think it would be even more interesting, but I hate that she is a science experiment.
Chris:        Of course.
Caller:        But they took her tumor and they sent it to a lab and they actually ... They didn't do it the first time around, but the second time they read the whole ... I don't know science very well, but they were able to find out what mutations were in her tumor and what was causing it, which is amazing that they can do that now and is the direction that cancer treatment is going, where they just- each individual tumor gets its own reading and then it's on medications based on that.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        And they found out that hers, which they never, ever would have put the two together, but hers actually had the mutations that are common in melanoma, so skin cancer. So she's being treated like she has skin cancer, which has never, ever been done to a child with her type of cancer. And really, I don't know that other children are even using this kind of medication. This was a brand new thing.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        So yeah. Isn't that crazy? It just blows my mind how it works.
Chris:        I would imagine ...
Caller:        And ...
Chris:        Oh no. Go for it.
Caller:        I can't hear- sorry- but she had to sign. I have this picture of her signing this form that said that they could try this out on her. It's crazy. It's just crazy. And I just step back every once in a while and think I can't believe it's my life. I can't believe this is my daughter's life. But it is and you just make the best of it when that's what you have.
Caller:        So yeah, she's just on this trial and we get scans every six weeks. And we actually, my husband and I took the images last night from her scan and tried to decipher what we could, if it's growing or not. I didn't sleep very well last night, I can tell you that much.
Chris:        Yeah. I bet. So when you say that they discovered this about your daughter's, the mutations, is it the type of thing that now they know that and they might start checking into that with other kids sooner? Is that ...
Caller:        Yeah. I'm curious about that. I'll ask the doctor today. I haven't actually asked that specific question, but I think that's kind of the direction that they are going to start going. Because they lump these [coughs], you know 'Rhabdos', they lump them all together, but really, each of them is different. Each person is different and so they also were able to test some of the drugs that they gave her the first time around on this bit of a tumor and it was totally resistant to that.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        So all this chemo that she's been through was probably not doing anything. And I think that's pretty common with her type of cancer for sure because it's just so rare and there's not a lot of research done because of that.
Chris:        Yeah. If they're doing trials on stuff, does that also mean that they help ... Does that help ease some of the financial burden?
Caller:        We ... Our insurance covered it.
Chris:        Oh thank God.
Caller:        Yeah. We just had to pay our deductible.
Chris:        That's incredible.
Caller:        So yeah it is, yeah. In fact it's crazy. My husband started a new job so we had to start our deductible over again. So we had to pay out of pocket up to our max which is 7000, which is, I mean of course it feels like a lot of money, but it's nothing compared to what some other people have to pay or for what we'd have to pay without insurance. And scary with the new changes in ...
Chris:        Oh you must be ... You must watch that with a different perspective than almost anybody else.
Caller:        Yeah, well it's just my daughter.
Chris:        Anybody else.
Caller:        Yeah. My daughter won't be covered for things like ... I don't know. I'm not ... I can't think about that again. So this one, so we had to pay things again. So we called to order one of her pills that she takes and it was $3000 for one bottle of pills. We had to pay with our credit card $3000. And you know, we'll max out at $7000 and then we won't have to pay a dime after that. But just one bottle of pills. It's crazy, crazy.
Chris:        Everybody ... There's people who get mad at me for being political on this show, but I have to say it is such- it's just undeniably sad to me that if your husband lost his job a couple years ago that you'd have to pay that. That is just ... There's something so ... That's twisted. That's so twisted that's okay to people.
Caller:        Yeah. I agree.
Chris:        That's twisted.
Caller:        That's one bottle of pills. We're in here all the time. I can't even imagine how much it costs. I can't even imagine.
Chris:        Yeah. There's an alternate reality where you and your husband and your four other kids are suffering for life if you ...
Caller:        Oh yeah, for life. A lot of people do. A lot of people do. I can't even imagine if we were dealing with that on top of the emotional stress of, you know, watching your child suffer and then having financial. We've been blessed with people reaching out, fundraisers and so we really have not had to pay medical bills.
Chris:        Yeah. Thank God.
Caller:        Pretty much at all, which is ... I know. I know. Once again the goodness. But we are fortunate and we have an amazing community. Not everyone has that. A lot of people don't have that and I really just can't imagine. Awful.
Chris:        You say you have people fundraising and it sounds like the community is really stepping up. Here's a question I have. Do you and your husband ever get a date night or is that just not a factor at this point?
Caller:        Yeah we do, absolutely. No. It is a factor, for sure. Yes. Yeah. We definitely do. I like to go ... I'll meet him for lunch maybe sometimes while he's at work or I have a sister that lives locally who just, she hasn't had her own kids. She's actually being married in a few weeks. She's 40 and has finally found someone that works that she's going to get married to and so that's super exciting. But until this point, she's just been single and has lived close and so she watches the kids. And you know, we'll go away for the weekend. So yes, that's huge for me to make that happen.
Chris:        Yeah. It must be if you can find an hour where you're not thinking about this stuff, that must be ... It's like the sun coming through the clouds, huh?
Caller:        It is. Oh my goodness. I can't even tell you. We, so she was diagnosed, again, in January. And we really don't know how much longer she has. And so she had in 2015, if a child gets diagnosed with cancer, they get a Make-A-Wish trip. It's just an automatic thing. But we were waiting until she was done with treatment. And we wanted her port out of her because if they have a port, every time they get a fever and they have to go to the hospital. It's just kind of a pain. We just wanted all this behind us and then we wanted to go take this magical trip. And so we had it planned for March of this year, March 2017 and she was diagnosed again in January and I was just so scared we'd have to kiss it goodbye.
Caller:        She wished to go to Disney World and we get, you know, it's this week long, the park's in Florida and she’s so excited. You know, something to look forward to and something I could talk to her about when she was sick and we would dream about this trip that she would be able to take. So we thought we had lost that opportunity.
Caller:        But last week, she was able to kind of rally ... what was that?
Chris:        So you had to cancel the trip?
Caller:        We didn't. She was able to rally. We worked the Chemos around it and we went on this ... I mean, I just can't even tell you how great it was to see her laugh and smile and play. And we just forgot. Just for a week, we went and we just forgot that she had a problem and that ... sorry.
Chris:        No. That's okay.
Caller:        So yes. We love those moments. They're amazing and so much more precious that they would have been otherwise. Usually when you take kids to places like that, you're usually just surviving because they're crying and they want and I don't know, it can be pretty miserable.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Taking five kids to an amusement park. But we got spoiled with Make-A-Wish and it was just perfect. It was pure joy. I had a friend that also had a friend die of breast cancer. She was diagnosed with cancer and so I kind of reached out to her when she was first diagnosed. And she talked about how your lows will be the all-time lows and the highs will be higher than anything you've felt. And, you know, those moments are pretty amazing, those highs. So we've had some neat experiences. And some amazing memories and lots to hold onto. And ...
Chris:        Did any of the characters step up ...
Caller:        ... hope to make a lot more memories.
Chris:        Did any of the characters step up?
Caller:        Oh yeah. I really can't ... I mean Make A Wish is pretty top-notch.
Chris:        Who stepped up the most? Are you always going to have a memory where you're ...
Caller:        Who stepped up the most?
Chris:        You're always going to look back, Chip and Dale? Solid.
Caller:        Chip and Dale.
Chris:        Chip and Dale. Solid.
Caller:        We did not even see ... Okay, let me see if there was one.
Chris:        Goofy you kind of dropped the ball, you phoned it in.
Caller:        Well she loves Belle.
Chris:        For Make A Wish, you phoned it in Goofy. She loves who?
Caller:        She loves those princesses and they were really sweet to her. And you know, Universal Studios Harry Potter World, they treated us like gold.
Chris:        Wow. Really, you get the two-fer on that?
Caller:        You actually, yeah. These kids are pretty spoiled. They have to go through a lot to get it. I always tell my other kids who didn't go through much I know it's hard to have a sick sibling with cancer, but come on. I had to tell them many times that we- you guys, this is not reality. Don't think this is normal. We're never ... Because we didn't wait in a single line anywhere we went. We went to Sea World, no lines, Disney World.
Chris:        You had a fast pass on every Disney ride. You don't even have to sign up for the fast pass.
Caller:        No. And it was even better than the fast pass. It was the royal treatment. It was pretty amazing.
Chris:        For anybody who doesn't know, Disney World you get two rides you get to pick the fast pass where you basically get to cut the line and it becomes this weird ...
Caller:        Yeah. Oh, I've done it before that way.
Chris:        Yeah. It becomes this weird gamesmanship.
Caller:        I've done it both ways.
Chris:        Oh yeah. Look at that. The ultimate fast pass is a tragic diagnosis.
Caller:        It comes with a price. Yep, yep. Exactly.
Chris:        Oh God, I feel bad about that joke.
Caller:        It comes with a price, but no. It was awesome. It was an amazing trip and like you said, we just forgot and just played. And she was just a normal little girl. And then we got back Sunday and Monday morning, she was back in the hospital hooked up to IVs being pumped with poison. Crazy the contrast and yeah. It's rough.
Chris:        Oh. That's a bad Monday. That's a bad Monday for everybody.
Caller:        It was bad. Mondays are always bad. Every week, every Monday is bad for me. That's her chemo days, so we just know...
Chris:        Every single week she gets chemo.
Caller:        She ... So we've gone through a bunch of different things. Initially yes and then it was too much. She was too sick. And we've always believed that, you know, we've always thought quality over quantity with this because what's the point of being pumped full of this stuff and having a miserable ... I mean, if I knew, if they could tell me it would work, then I would do anything and she would do anything. But where it's so, there's so many unknowns, we've always thought for her to have a good life, you know, more good days than bad. So we backed off a little bit. So now we come in a little less, but still every other Monday. It's still enough.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Is there any knowing ... Hearing what you just said, knowing you want more good days than bad, hearing that you say maybe we take our foot off the gas on some of the treatments. So it sounds a little bit like you're ...
Caller:        Yeah. That's the question. That's what we ... My next conversation in 20 minutes or whatever is going to be with the doctor and if it's grown, I think we're done. I think she's tired and we're tired. And they've gone to the extreme to try and find something that they would hope would work. And maybe it's still working. I try and be as optimistic as I can, but it's hard. Sometimes it just gets heavy. And definitely, you know, we've talked to her and she knows if she has some of her chemo, she takes daily chemo pills so she's always got it in her and it's hard for her to do that.
Caller:        But she knows I have to take them. If I don't take them I'm going to die. She's really just, we're all very open about what's required and that her little life is on the line. She knows it and we know it and I think I don't have a need to push her just for me to make her suffer and go through so much in hopes that something might work when really, there's just, there's not a cure right now. And so we're trying.
Chris:        And does she ever express anything like that? Do you have to hear stuff like that? Does your kid ever say hey ... Does your kid ever express that?
Caller:        That it's too much?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah. The pills, it's hard. She's taken pills and thrown them all up again. And she went through, in October 2015 she had to go through 30 radiation treatments. So she's strapped, totally, nailed pretty much into this mask on this table and that in itself, I mean, I think that was the most traumatic month of my life and her life. And during that time, it caused so much inflammation in her throat and her mouth that she had pills that she had to take at that time they literally could not go down because she was so swollen and she kind of gagged up that.
Caller:        And so that experience has made it so it's just super traumatic for her always to take these pills. So yeah, she'll just have nights where she's like, "I can't do it." And I'm like, "All right. That's fine. Don't do it then." You know, we just respect her ... We respect when it's too much. We totally respect that. And if she were to tell me today even if the results were good I can't do anymore, I would 100% respect her because she's fought long enough. It's not like, you know, the first time around, there's no way. I would have made her see it through because her chances were higher. But this time, I ask her every day, "You want to keep doing it?" Not every day, but often, "Do you want to keep doing it? You sure? You got it in you?"
Caller:        And she's a little fighter. She's a fighter for sure. She finished up her fourth grade year, went to as many days of school as she could even if it meant she threw up in her classroom, which happened. She just was still ... And all of it was are you sure you want to go to school today? You sure? Yeah. I have enough time and I need to finish. I mean, she just, she keeps living life and we let her. You’ve got to try not to ever ... We're definitely not the parents that have her lay in bed all day. She's still learning how to play the piano and playing sports when she can. She still has a life.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Crazy stuff.
Chris:        Oh boy. This one got me.
Caller:        Sorry.
Chris:        What if you were like right now, "None of this is true. I made you cry," and then hung up?
Caller:        Oh I wish. I wish, I wish. I wish all the time it wasn't true. It's so true, though. It's true life of a little 10-year-old girl.
Chris:        Yeah. I tell you something. I can't believe your ability to just talk about this and just tell me and tell everybody listening about all this stuff and hold it together. All five of those kids are really lucky they've got a mom like you.
Caller:        Oh that's so nice of you. They ... I'm going to make them listen to this podcast, especially the teenagers. They need to hear that.
Chris:        Just that part. You just isolate that. We can probably isolate that clip for you. You can just play that on a loop.
Caller:        Yes. I'm going to. They're going to love it!
Chris:        They'll be like, "Mom, why ..."
Caller:        Validation from someone that's famous. I mean you're kind of famous and I'm going to say, "You guys, listen to this guy."
Chris:        The lowest level, the lowest level.
Caller:        Yeah, well. It'll be enough. I promise it'll be enough. I'll have them listen to it and they can ...
Chris:        And they'll be like, "Why are you making us listen to a crying man in his 30s talk about how awesome you are?"
Caller:        I'll take it anywhere I can get it because you don't get it from your kids very much, I'll tell you what. They're not always very validating.
Chris:        Yeah, but they gotta know. They know in their hearts. They gotta know in their hearts that you're ...
Caller:        I think ... I hope so. I think they're getting a little better, but we have definitely had our moments.
Chris:        You know what though?
Caller:        For sure.
Chris:        Here's something I know because I feel as I get older ...
Caller:        What?
Chris:        As I get older, I realize that one of the main reasons to have kids so there's somebody to hang out with you and take care of you when you get older.
Caller:        It's true. It's true.
Chris:        I bet when you and your husband are that age ...
Caller:        But you don't have kids.
Chris:        I don't. I don't.
Caller:        Are you going to have kids?
Chris:        Some day. Some day let's hope, right? Let's hope.
Caller:        They're worth it. They're worth it. They're so much work it. They are so much work, but they're worth it.
Chris:        When you and your husband are retirement age, my prediction is that your kids, they take care of you better than most people get. I bet they're going to realize what they got because we all do when we're older.
Caller:        Well, we'll see. I don't know.
Chris:        We all do when we're older.
Caller:        We'll see.
Chris:        They're going to take care of you, all those kids.
Caller:        We definitely love each other, but there's plenty of fighting that goes on in our house.
Chris:        Yeah. Of course there is. Of course there is.
Caller:        We're a pretty normal house.
Chris:        Yeah. How's your ... Your husband is with you right now?
Caller:        He is. He's just listening in. And he actually ... I am not on Twitter, but he ... I told him he had to get on Twitter so he could let me know if ... It would bug me I get Twitter whatever, tweets all the time, so he gave me the number. So we drove separately because he has to go to work afterwards and as soon as we got out of the car, he's like, "Just call in. He just sent a tweet out. Call in." And so he's just sitting here ...
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        ... listening in on the conversation.
Chris:        He's a good guy, huh? Good guy.
Caller:        Yes. He's the best. He's the best. Yep. I lucked out.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah. What else do you want to know?
Chris:        I don't know. Let's see. What else do you want to ... That's kind of a loaded question in the middle of this one. I don't know. And you said you're getting news in 15 minutes, huh?
Caller:        Yeah. You really have been the best distraction. It's been great.
Chris:        Glad to be a distraction.
Caller:        I was ... I woke up super nauseous.
Chris:        Here's the thing. You want to hear how petty I am? You want to hear?
Caller:        Yeah. Absolutely. I love stuff like that. I love hearing how boring. I love it.
Chris:        So here's the thing, right? I got the anxiety. I got the depression. My emotions notoriously not under my control and I get worked up about stuff. And I've been real mad all day because here's how much you put me in perspective, here's how much this call got me in check. Somebody on Facebook yesterday, because you were saying, you were saying I'm famous. And I don't think I'm famous. I think I am again, lowest rung.
Caller:        Well you're well-known.
Chris:        Lowest rung. I can recognize now that I'm more well known. The HBO thing now I can't deny. I can't pretend to be Mr. Underground Punk Rock anymore. HBO I recognize okay, I'm in the public sphere. Guy on Facebook yesterday sends me a comment, "Hey man. My friend took a picture of you last night eating gelato. You want to see it?" And I've been furious. I've been furious. All day I've been ...
Caller:        About that? Oh yeah, you can't be mad about that.
Chris:        No. I'm not going to be ever again after this call. I've been sitting there like 'I was on a date with my wife'-
Caller:        Unh-uh (negative). No way. No way.
Chris:        Some weirdo took a picture of me eating gelato. That's weird. Nobody looks good eating gelato. What? I'm just trying to eat my gelato with my wife out on my date. Man, that's so messed up. This is the worst thing to happen in my life. And then you call me and you're like, "My child has been a superhero fighting through pain that no child should have to endure."
Caller:        Okay, but I will say I still get mad about some things, too.
Chris:        Yeah?
Caller:        It's okay.
Chris:        Because I'm feeling real petty right now that I'm mad that I get to live in New York City and eat gelato.
Caller:        And I'll be honest, I would hate ... No but I would hate that if you couldn't just go on a date with your wife and have someone taking a picture. That would drive me crazy.
Chris:        It's the second time someone has taken a secret picture of me while I'm eating and as I have gotten more well-known, I figured out that is my number one that creeps me out pet peeve. Other things ...
Caller:        It's just going to keep happening, too.
Chris:        Yeah. Why did I sign up for this?
Caller:        It's your life now.
Chris:        I'm not built for this.
Caller:        I've always wondered, celebrities and how, I mean how do you just, how do you go out in public? Do you try and stay out of the public because of that?
Chris:        No. See, because I'm at a place I'm now famous enough that people will stop me. And it's 99% of the time, it's very nice. Like even yesterday, I was on the subway and this dude sat next to me and was like, "Hey wait? You're Chris Gethard. You were on HBO." I'm like, "Yeah, man. What's up?" He's like, "I really liked your special. That was pretty cool that you put all that stuff out there." I'm like, "Yeah. Thanks man." And he's like, "All right." And I just went back to reading my book.
Caller:        And that was it.
Chris:        We were just sitting next to so I could feel that zoom.
Caller:        So you can go on a subway and be anonymous and people don't know who you are?
Chris:        Here's the thing. I am famous enough that I will get recognized on the subway, but I am not famous enough that I don't have to take the subway. I do not have enough money to not take the subway anymore. I'm still ...
Caller:        Okay. But that might change in your life.
Chris:        Who wants it to?
Caller:        Would you be sad if that changed?
Chris:        I don't want to be that guy. I'm from Jersey baby. I never want to be that guy. I don't want to be that guy.
Caller:        No. Right? Wouldn't that be tragic?
Chris:        Oh my life tragic. You telling me ... How did things go so wrong? How did I make it about me to the degree that you're telling me my life has any tragedy? People say nice ... Oh people say nice things to me on the subway.
Caller:        You know what? I'm going to be totally honest. Everyone has their own tragedies, their own whatever and so whatever it is ...
Chris:        Oh God. Never felt like a bigger, more worthless piece of shit than right now. You telling me that me having people say kind things to me on the subway is tragic. You are a saint. You are a superhero. You are a saint and a superhero and I'm some fucking dummy who gets a lot of credit.
Caller:        Whatever, no.
Chris:        Making jokes. Nothing about my life is tragic. Everything is happy.
Caller:        No.
Chris:        Everything is happy. The sun is shining even while it's raining. Oh God.
Caller:        It's so impossible to be that way every day, though, even when life's perfect. I don't think it's how the human person was made unfortunately.
Chris:        Yeah. I get it.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So let's bring it back down. Let's bring it back down. I got a question that's on my mind. So I got a question on my mind and I feel like I have to ask it. And that I'm sure you've thought about so many times is that, you know, here's what I'm praying for and what I think everybody is sending your way is that your kid fights through this again and that the next time you get past this, it's not just for a year. That it's for life. That's what we're all praying for.
Caller:        It would be amazing. Yep.
Chris:        It would be amazing. And I'm sending every ounce of whatever, karma, prayer, whatever it is, every ounce of me wants that. I'm sure you've thought about it.
Caller:        Well, thank you.
Chris:        I'm sure you have thought about how you're going to react if and when it goes the other way.
Caller:        Oh yeah. I mean that's all I thought about last night. Yes. Yeah. And I can't. I mean I don't ... Is that your question? How am I gonna feel?
Chris:        Yes. Nobody should have to sit around and think about that, but you have to and what's that like? I can't imagine.
Caller:        I have to. That's my life. And I think that, yeah, that's the hardest part. And how do I tell her? I think that's what ... That is ... I don't want to go home today and tell her that all of this hasn't worked. I don't want to have to do that and I might. Right. Yeah. It might be my day today. I wish I was worried about someone taking pictures of me eating gelato. I wish that was my biggest concern.
Chris:        Yeah. I'm never complaining about anything ever again. Believe me. Believe me.
Caller:        You will and so will I about things that don't matter.
Chris:        Just want to put on record ...
Caller:        And telling the other kids ...
Chris:        Gelato is so good by the way.
Caller:        And telling ... I'm going to get gelato today or something.
Chris:        Salted caramel. It's really good.
Caller:        My daughter and I, we're going to go get some gelato.
Chris:        Yeah. Please do. Please do.
Caller:        I don't even know if we have gelato out here, though, to be honest.
Chris:        Well ice cream. Ice cream is fine.
Caller:        Frozen yogurt.
Chris:        Yeah, there you go, FroYo.
Caller:        That's what we do, frozen yogurt. We'll go get her FroYo.
Chris:        That kid gets limitless toppings, huh?
Caller:        Yeah. And telling the other kids and telling my ... I mean I just ... A lot of it, I mean we have it ... We could make a lot of people sad today and I hate the weight of that, just that there's a lot, a lot of people that are rooting for this little girl and I don't want to make them sad. I don't want to ... Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        So hoping for good news. But you know, I'll be honest. Even the good news is still heavy because it still means she takes pills every night and every morning and she still has to come for chemo. And when we go camping next weekend, she's still going to be sick and have to spend most of the time just laying in the tent where everyone else is riding their bikes, playing in the lake, which is what she wants to do.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        So either way, it's hard.
Chris:        So the best news you get right now is we get to keep fighting.
Caller:        We got to keep fighting. Keep doing what we're doing, which is hard.
Chris:        We get to keep suffering.
Caller:        Yeah. That's the best they can give us. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it just ... Yeah.
Chris:        This is ... You said it was rhabdomyosarcoma. Is that what I wrote down?
Caller:        Very good. Wow. How did you just say that again?
Chris:        Wrote it down. Wrote it down, to be fair. To be fair.
Caller:        I was going to say. When they first told me at that first appointment which is awful, you can only imagine. He kept saying, the doctor kept saying this word. I'm like, "What are you saying? Will you say it again?" I think I had him say it five times and then finally I'm like, "Will you please write it down. I can't." And then we had to tell this 8-year-old little girl: ‘Can you say it? Rhabdomyosarcoma.’ So we're teaching our little 8-year-old. Say it again. How do you say it? And it was just this fun word and then she finally got it. We were like, "You can say it. That's amazing." So sorry. It's kind of been an issue because it's such a crazy big, long word. So good job. All right. Your question?
Chris:        Well I was going to say, you said this is really rare. Is this the type of thing that anybody listening who has heard of it immediately would just clench up? It's that type of thing, huh?
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. A lot of kids do make it. There are some. I don't know how well you know ... I didn't know childhood cancers before this, but I know everything now. So there's one, DIPG, and that's the bad one. That's the one that they really just don't know. Humans of New York, did I say that right?
Chris:        Yeah. That's a thing.
Caller:        That's the guy that takes pictures, right? So he did a whole thing on childhood cancer and I loved it because he shed light on so much and kind of went into DIPG. That one is a death sentence and it's just a given that they're not going to make it. Rhabdo is, you know, I'd say 50/50. But Leukemia is now 98% chance that you can be cured. It wasn't 40 years ago, but now it is. So hopefully, Rhabdo will be the same as that some day, where ... You know.
Chris:        Does it give you any hope knowing that when they study what's going on with your daughter and when they find things like that melanoma thing, that might help get people there in 50 years?
Caller:        Totally. Totally. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sad she might not be the one to make it. And she might. I mean, you know, we don't know.
Chris:        Yeah. I want it.
Caller:        We keep hopeful when we can. Yeah. Maybe she's cured of this and it will be huge. Her treatment will be life changing in the whole field of Rhabdo for sure. And the doctors told us, you know, there's a lot of people very interested to see what happens with ... And we're kind of, I think they aren't always super happy with us because we ... Like this trip to Spain totally messed up the treatment and I don't think the doctor was very excited about us doing it. We actually found out on a Saturday. So they've had her birthday, end of April and it was awful, awful. She had the treatments.
Caller:        We had been on this new treatment, this new trial for about four weeks at this point and she, her mouth was completely full of sores to the point that she could not eat. So she requested ... I make them their breakfast on their birthday and she'd requested waffles with strawberries and cream. And so I made her breakfast and she just sobbed as she was trying to eat this one bite of waffle because it hurt her so bad. And the whole day was just, it was awful. She ate maybe half a McDonald's shake for the entire day. It was awful.
Caller:        So all time low. I think that might have been one of her hardest days. And then the next day we find out there was this opportunity for a family to go to Spain. The trip had already been planned for a different kid. It's still a sad story. Another kid that was supposed to go that wasn't able to go, but they had it all in place and they were offering it to other people and I was like, "Yes. We need a break. This is too much. Let me get away. Let me just get a break."
Caller:        So then we went to the doctor that Monday and I was actually pretty scared to tell him. We were like, "We have this opportunity and we want to take it. And they're like, "Well, you're going to be off the trial if we do it" and you know, they kind of push back a little. They're super respectful and they've been great to work with, but I have pushed where I could. `And so we just took her off everything at that point, gave her a week to kind of start feeling better and then left the following Wednesday. The four of us didn't even have passports. So we went to an agency and were able to get passports.
Caller:        And then we just went for that week and played and loved it. And it was the best thing we did because we created memories. And she was able to, you know, feel better from this. And that helped us to see they're doing too much. It's too much. We can't do everything they're asking. And so we kind of pushed back on ... So we've called the shots more than they maybe would have wanted us to, but yeah, I felt like it's obviously, obviously important to fight for my daughter's happiness.
Caller:        So as far as trials are concerned, there are a lot of people interested and a lot of people that are watching what's happening and yeah, what the results will be.
Chris:        Yeah. I mean that's really, that's ... It seems like you and your husband do a really good job of making sure this doesn't just turn into a science experiment.
Caller:        It's been super ... It's been really ... Yeah. Last year, I let's read books and I was in a book club with some friends. And we read this book called Being Mortal. And it was a game changer. I needed to read that at that time because it's really helped me this time around just to know ... It's written by I don't know. The book, it's written by a doctor who kind of deals with life and death scenarios and he's very open about when doctors go too far.
Caller:        And he talks about an instance in his own career, where this young mother who had just had a baby was diagnosed with cancer. And he knew that the treatment was not going to work, but he couldn't tell them that and so he just gave them this treatment. Let's try this. Let's see if this works, knowing that the chances were slim or zero, but he didn't have the heart to tell them that there was no hope. And they put her on this chemo that made her terribly sick and pretty much took away what she could have had at the end of her life. And I refuse to let that happen. So that's why always ... That's been a big thing. More good days than bad and if it's not, it's not worth it.
Chris:        That seems like impossible decisions to make, but holy shit, is that the definition of being a good parent ...
Caller:        It's so hard.
Chris:        ... in this situation, though? What a crazy thing for you and your husband to constantly say what is ...
Caller:        Right. Yep.
Chris:        What is the decision that is being a good parent right now?
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. Yep. It's pretty impossible. Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Somehow we've made it this far, though. And honestly, had more happy moments than sad.
Chris:        That's incredible to hear.
Caller:        And I think, you know, I think you can choose. I think you can choose to a degree how much you let that be the case and from the beginning, I just, I didn't want it to defeat us. I mean so many marriages are broken from tragedies like this and I just didn't want ... I wanted to still have a good life and for her to still be happy. I mean we ... She had this little interview recently with this cancer organization that does things for kids and they were just trying to get an idea of how they've helped and what they can- what more they could do. And so I was kind of prepping her because she's a really shy girl and she doesn't like ... She likes to know what she's going to have to- what she's going to be asked.
Caller:        And so I was prepping her. They had given me the questions and I asked her some of the questions. And I asked her, I think one of the questions was how do you feel ... The last time you were at the hospital, what were some things that you felt like? What were your emotions? And her first thing was happy. I mean, we have created magic out of tragedy and it's just we make it a party when we come and she has this chemo pal that comes and brings her games. And she does art which she loves.
Caller:        And she has mom by her side, all to herself. I mean, she's number four of five and obviously, would have kind of gotten lost in all that normally, but now she gets this one-on-one that she just absolutely loves. And so for her, really truly the overall, the take-home for her is happiness. It's amazing. It's amazing.
Chris:        Yeah. We got about a minute and a half.
Caller:        So life can be good.
Chris:        Life can be good.
Caller:        Are you kidding? That means I have to go talk. One minute you said?
Chris:        About a minute and a half, yeah.
Caller:        I should go have that scary conversation now. Well thank you.
Chris:        No please. I hope you get really great news.
Caller:        Hoping for good news.
Chris:        Thank you for ...
Caller:        Me, too.
Chris:        Thanks for telling us and I really hope it all goes well and I hope ...
Caller:        Either way. Either way we're going to keep seeing the love that's everywhere.
Chris:        Yeah. Love is everywhere.
Caller:        We're big believers that love is everywhere.
Chris:        And I hope next year on her birthday she's just eating her waffles.
Caller:        Yeah. I'm going to go get our ... Celebrate some happy news today with some FroYo.
Chris:        Yeah. That would be good.
Caller:        That's the goal for today.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah.
Caller:        All right.
Chris:        Okay. Good ... So much good luck to you sincerely.
Caller:        Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye.
Chris:        Bye.
