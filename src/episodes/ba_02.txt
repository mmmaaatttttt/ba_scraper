Caller:        Hello? Is this Chris?
Chris:        Yeah, Hi.
Caller:        Hey Chris, how are you?
Chris:        Doing pretty good I got to say. Feeling okay today. Went to the gym, got the adrenaline up, you know those endorphins, feeling good.
Caller:        That's awesome, that's the opposite of me. I was just about to lay down and take a nap and then I saw that you were filming and I was like, "Oh, I should call!"
Chris:        I don't want to interrupt a nap.
Caller:        I was listening to the music. Well, I was listening to the music and I was trying not to fall asleep with your scary intro music that you have.
Chris:        Yeah, people have said the intro music is weird and somewhat terrifying. But here is an announcement, Jared has figured out how to switch it so I am going to curate a playlist. I'm going to replace that any day now. Any day now.
Caller:        Something happy and upbeat would be good.
Chris:        Thank you so much for the suggestion. What if it was all super dark? What if I made it worse, what if I made it really dark, just like black metal, like those metal bands from Northern Europe that sing about burying down churches? Like what if I replaced the intro music and they I was like, "Yeah, you guys shouldn't have complained. You didn't even know how good you had it back then."
Caller:        You are definitely setting a tone for the show I feel like. You get people in this very pensive mood.
Chris:        I've never heard the whole music.
Caller:        It's intense.
Chris:        I have no idea what it sounds like.
Caller:        Really? It sounds kind of Chopin-esque. It was some sort of piano, I don't know, it's just creepy.
Chris:        Yeah, Jared's just typed it's weird, atonal, piano music.
Caller:        Exactly, exactly. That's precisely what it is.
Chris:        Okay. So what about you? What's up?
Caller:        Oh man, well I was just... what is up? I'm sorry, I'm just waking up from my half nap. I have been thinking about something for the past week that I've been talking with a couple of my friends about, and maybe if you want to give me advice on the situation, or talk with me about it?
Chris:        That sounds good.
Caller:        Basically... so basically, when I was about 15 years old I had an inappropriate relationship with a former teacher of mine.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        This is something that I actually... It's interesting to talk about now because I really don't think about it a lot. I don't feel that it traumatized me in any way. I feel like I have a very good life, I have a pretty happy, fulfilled, wonderful life. I don't know, a lot of people I feel like, who talk about this stuff feel very traumatized by it and I actually don't think it affected me in a really adverse way.
Caller:        But I have not thought about this a lot over the last 10 years because I've been out of contact with this person. And I ran into this teacher last week at Starbucks.
Chris:        Wow. What if that was all just a clever way to have grassroots Starbucks advertising, what if that was all a secret Starbucks ad? Just you landing on Starbucks.
Chris:        So I need you to walk... Where do you want to start? Do you want to tell me how this relationship developed? Or do you want to tell me what this current day encounter was like? I want to hear both.
Caller:        Sure, I guess I could tell you how it developed. So he was one of my middle school teachers. He was an incredibly popular teacher, won the teacher of the year kind of people. I guess he was always my favorite teachers, and I wouldn't say that I had a crush on him per se, but I always really admired him. He was one of those teachers that I would love to go and hang out in his classroom after school. Really just loved his class, thought he was hilarious, really looked up to him I guess, as more of a mentor, than anything else. And he kind of took me under his wing. I was teacher's pet.
Caller:        It's interesting because I didn't really... looking, I guess maybe that is something interesting for me know, because looking back I see some of the ways in which some of the contact even when I was his student was slightly inappropriate. But I didn't necessarily see it that way at the time. I remember when I did really bad on a math exam, he bought me a book and gave me a book the next day to comfort me about it, or he would message me on AOL instant messenger after school.
Chris:        Oh boy.
Caller:        And we would talk about... I know, it seems so inappropriate now, but at the time I just kind of brushed it aside, right?
Caller:        And my parents actually discovered that we were talking on AOL and my Dad almost went in to talk to the principal at the time, because I remember he noticed something that he had said to me to the effect of, "You looked really pretty today.", or, "That was a nice dress today." Something fairly innocuous but still slightly inappropriate.
Chris:        Yeah, very inappropriate, right?
Caller:        And my Dad-
Chris:        Teacher on AOL telling a kid that they had a pretty dress. So your Dad sees these messages?
Caller:        Right, so my Dad sees these messages and he was irate and he wanted to go in and speak with him. And I begged him not to, and my Mom actually ended up asking him not to as well because I think my Mom was also under his charm, knowing what a positive influence he had been in my life in so many ways. And she didn't want to cause trouble for me and she believed me when I was saying that it's completely innocuous and he doesn't mean anything by it, et cetera, et cetera.
Caller:        So, he didn't do anything about it at the time and neither did my Mom, and nothing inappropriate was happening-
Chris:        Did the teacher know? Where you like, "Hey, my Dad's mad at you. Cool out."? Did he know?
Caller:        No, I didn't say anything about, because I think at the point nothing was going on, besides speaking outside of school and him showering me with affection, and saying that, I guess kind of being a mentor figure and an important person in my life. But he wasn't overtly... that's as far as his compliments would go. He wasn't flirting with me or nothing inappropriate was going on besides that.
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        Our conversation. So and I guess at the time I was sort of going through a hard time with my family. My family moved around a lot, my Mom deals with some medical sensitivity stuff and she's never really happy staying in one place so we moved, I was always in the same school district but I was the richest homeless girl you've ever met. My mom would decide that we all of a sudden had to go live in a hotel because there was mold in our basement, kind of thing.
Caller:        So he might have been one of those mentors providing some sort of stability to me and being someone I could go and vent about how crazy my family was. And I think my Mom appreciated him being kind of a rock for me and I think that was maybe one of the reasons she didn't want to confront him either.
Caller:        So anyway, he was just a really good teacher to me that year, and then I was probably twelve or thirteen at that time and then I stayed in touch with him when I started high school. And I would come back after school and help him grade papers, and just our friendship continued essentially.
Caller:        Trying to think when it turned. I guess I had lent him, it was the summer before my sophomore year and I was 15, and I had lent him a book that he invited me to drop by his apartment and pick up. That was the first time that he kissed me. I just ran up to the apartment to grab this book and then I was on my way to the airport actually, I was leaving on some sort of school trip to Europe. And then from there on it became this really, more of an emotional relationship than anything else. I never slept with him, it was more just maybe some intense make out sessions, sorry, TMI.
Caller:        But a lot of, kind of an emotional affair, I guess is how I would describe it. A lot of late night chats, and emotional conversations, and slightly inappropriate physical advances.
Chris:        So you said it never became full on sexual but you were making out. I just want to be clear. I think that's what you said, right?
Caller:        Yeah, that's correct. There was a little bit of heavy petting but there was nothing explicitly or full on sexual.
Chris:        Wow... I got a lot of opinions.
Caller:        I'm sure you do.
Chris:        How long did it go on for?
Caller:        It lasted a year and a half.
Chris:        A year and half with you making out with this teacher?
Caller:        A year and a half, and I ended up cutting it off when I was 16 and a half, it was mid way through my Junior year of high school. And I think had I wanted it to go further sexually it definitely would have. Fortunately for me I was a huge goody, goody two shoes in high school. I was going to wait till marriage to have sex, I didn't drink, I didn't do drugs, I was a very kind of good girl and I was also very strict kind of good two shoes when it came to my boundaries.
Caller:        So he respected that and he was really good about respecting my boundaries, and everything was completely consensual. But yeah, for a year and a half I made out with my teacher.
Chris:        Wow. Wow. Okay. And then what happened when you saw him now. I just want to hear all the facts and then we're, me and you, we're going to get into it. We are going to get into it on this one.
Chris:        So what happened when you ran into him at Starbucks? And did you keep in touch with this guy even after you cut it off? Or did it...
Caller:        Yeah, so I guess I should finish how it ended. So I cut it off when I was 16 and a half, midway through my Junior year, and my Senior year, after everything was over, my Mom ended up reading my diary and finding out everything that happened. I thought I was being super discreet about it but I wrote about it everything in this big black journal that was labeled (beep) diary with red letters on top.
Chris:        We will bleep that out. We will bleep that out. Mark the time code.
Caller:        Sorry!
Chris:        No, that's okay, that's okay. We are getting into it, we are feeling really loose here. Jared's noting the time code so we can bleep out a name that was inadvertently said.
Caller:        It's like you are telling the story to friends and then... yeah.
Chris:        So your Mom finds it, does she lose her mind?
Caller:        So she, yeah, she was incredibly upset on so many levels. First of all, she and my Dad felt terrible for not better protecting me, for not noticing the warning signs earlier. For not going in and talking to him as soon as my Dad had discovered those conversations.
Caller:        She was also really upset with me. She felt like she didn't know what she could trust anymore because I was a very, I was a good kid but in order to keep this affair going I lied a lot. It would be 10 o'clock and I would say, "Oh, I have to run to Safeway to pick up cookie dough to make cookies for school tomorrow." When in fact I was going to go meet him in a parking lot and make out in the car of half an hour kind of thing.
Caller:        So she didn't know if she could trust me and was really upset with me for lying to her, and was really upset with him for using her trust and my trust. And she wanted me to go forward to the school and basically say what had happened and turn him in. And encourage him to get counseling or get him to stop teaching. She didn't necessarily want him to go to jail or anything like that, but she wanted him out of the school system.
Caller:        And so I, at the time, I was really resistant to doing that because I cared a lot about him and because he was also married and I worried about him losing his job, I worried about him ruining his marriage.
Chris:        Okay. Sorry. I've been sitting on every reaction I have so we can get the facts out, but that one, that one... okay, that's pushing me past a bit of a tipping point.
Chris:        Okay, so he's married?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay.
Caller:        But anyway, I did end up actually cooperating with the school police about it. I wasn't going to and what ended up convincing me was my Dad took me out one night. And my Dad is like the most sweet man but so stoic and not emotional and he just broke down crying and was really apologetic for not being there more as a father. And thought this was all of his fault, and was convinced that there would probably be other girls in my situation. And so I ended up convincing myself that it was the best thing to go ahead and turn this guy in.
Caller:        So I cooperated with the internal school investigation and ended up recording a phone call with him as evidence of what was going on because they needed... I had deleted all my conversations and they needed concrete evidence that something had happened. And so the guy ended up losing his job, his teaching job, but he went on to do other things, had a career after that. I've loosely kept up over the years with what he has been up to on LinkedIn and different social networks.
Caller:        Right after I had turned him in, and the whole thing came crashing down, I had felt really terrible about it and I had written him a note, a sort of long apology letter about how I was so sorry and how I hope he understood. And he responded to that, basically saying, "Don't worry about it. I really care about you and I always will, but we can't speak for a number of years according to my lawyer for statutory limits and everything."
Caller:        So that was the last contact that I had had with him before I saw him at Starbucks.
Chris:        Wow. So can I give you my opinion? And then we will pick up with what happened at Starbucks. Because I just want this on record, because I have been biting my tongue.
Caller:        Sure, sure, go for it.
Chris:        I fucking hate this guy. I hate him so much I'm not even going to apologize to my Mom on that one because she is nodding in agreement. I hate this guy. He was an abuser and he manipulated you and I'm glad you are not traumatized by it, but you're so lucky that you are not. You're so lucky that you're not, because this guy sounds like a fucking creep. What a creep. That's my opinion.
Chris:        Because I will tell you what, I make most of... most of my career is as a standup comic and I think a lot of people that listen to the podcast only know me through this, I tour a lot. I do a lot of college shows, and it's so interesting because I am 36 years old and I do college shows, and I love them. I love them, and being around these college students who have something to say and who are these motivated people. It's really inspiring to be around that energy and the way they express their appreciation for art, it's the coolest thing.
Chris:        But there are some comics that are like, "Oh, college gigs. I'm going to sleep with a college girl." And at the age of 36 it is unfathomable to me. It's unfathomable to me. Let alone someone that... just age wise. The idea that a grownup would flirt with a 13 year old, the fact that he... is there... oh God, I am getting mad. You can hear it.
Chris:        You're well adjusted about this, you're so well adjusted and the last thing I want to do is put any like, "This is how you should be reacting.", but when I'm reacting, do you look back and you realize that... because I hear you saying you moved around a lot and you were a little foundation less as a kid. Do you feel like he targeted you? Like as soon as I hear that I'm like, "It sounds like he targeted you."
Caller:        Yeah, I think in a way for sure. I mean I think that's... I think what's tricky about these situations is they're... when you're a fifteen... yeah, it's troubling looking back. Seeing the friendship that started so close, as early as thirteen when I was a student of his. But I think there is some sort of gray area for me in my mind where I'm like, "Okay, pedophilia is young prepubescent children."
Caller:        But then when you are fifteen, sixteen there are girls that physically I think, could be walking down the street and a thirty year old guy could think that they are very attractive. But it is kind of like what you are saying, once you start talking to that person... I know now that I'm in my thirties and now when I'm around young twenty somethings or teens it's true that you can see someone and think, "Oh, they are an attractive person." And then they open their mouth and you're like, "Okay, they are so much younger and so less mature."
Caller:        So I don't know, I guess I've dealt with a lot of cognitive dissonance around that. I'm like, "While the attraction seems understandable." And I like to think that I... sorry, I'm kind of rambling.
Chris:        No, please.
Caller:        I like to think that I was... I was always a really good student and I think where that he was probably really effective is just being very flattering on how talented I was, and how smart i was. And so on the one hand he was this kind of incredible mentor in way. I know it sounds completely fucked up, but he was one of those people in my adolescents who was always there and believing in me, and telling me how much of a wonderful person I was, and how I was going to go off into the world and do anything I wanted to do. What a wonderful writer I was, how talented and when you get those kinds of compliments it's kind of... if feels manipulative and in the same way, in a weird fucked up way it was also helpful to me at that time. I think I got a lot of self confidence from his reinforcement and I think that I almost didn't find it weird that he liked me so much, because I also saw myself as a talented young woman. And I know that sounds weird.
Caller:        And so I think that in way in my head for this past decade, how I've been able to reconcile what happened, was by saying like, "Oh, I was this really mature for my age, beautiful, talented girl. And I was the exception to some rule. And it's a little odd but it's not out of the realm of possibility that an older man would fall so hard for me."
Caller:        Because it really was like he was in... and maybe he was lying about it but the impression or the way the relationship played out was more like a romantic relationship than it was a... I don't know, I've read some memoirs of people who have these student/teacher relationships and they are so explicitly sexual. And obviously... it was never like that. So-
Caller:        The people that have this teacher/student relationships and they are so explicitly sexual, and obviously abusive, and it was never like that. I don't know.
Chris:        And that's great. And a couple things I'm going to say, I don't know what I'm talking about. Haven't studied this stuff.
Caller:        Neither do I.
Chris:        I have an American Studies degree from Rutgers university, a mid level state school, I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm just going to tell you my gut reactions you were there, okay. You were in it, you are allowed to react however you want. I just feel like I have some responsibility to draw a line in the sand and say even hearing you say you were mature and you were talented, and I could see how somebody could fall for that, there is a part of me that needs to step in and say...
Chris:        Again, you were there. If the specifics of this or there is some miracle where love is involved, great. But I would say, the counter-side of that is the idea that you said before that you would sneak out of the house and tell your parents that you were going to buy cookie dough. And this guy know that you're doing that and he is making out with a fifteen year old kid. And he knows that kid just told her parents, "I left the house to get cookie dough.", that's warped. That's really warped. And it makes me want to put my fist through a wall.
Chris:        Honestly. It makes me want to cry my eyes out the idea that a kid would say, "I'm going to buy cookie dough.", and then this fucking married dude, who apparently is attracted to kids and put himself in an environment to be around them, could do that. Again, to me, I wasn't there... to me, there is no excuse and there is no world in which it's okay.
Caller:        Sure.
Chris:        And I'll say this too. There is a part of me that argues and thinks it's weirder that you just made out. There is something so weird about that. For some reason that's so weird. For some reason that bugs me, I don't know if anyone else would be thinking that, but that bugs me out even more.
Chris:        And the idea that you said it was almost like an emotional relationship... I'm just trying to think of in any world in which, as a man in my thirties I have to assume this guy, if he was a teacher he was at least in his mid twenties, you can presume probably a little older.
Chris:        How old was he when all of this was happening?
Caller:        He was mid thirties.
Chris:        A guy in... a guy my age having any sort of emotional connection with a fifteen year old girl, he knows it's wrong. He knows it's wrong. And you don't have to know it's wrong, and you're saying now like, "Oh now I can see maybe.", and it's great that it didn't traumatize you, but I would also say just a big hefty fuck that guy. He knew what he was doing. He knew it wasn't okay. He knew it wasn't okay and it's not okay, and I'm glad you can laugh about it now, but I just... I can't pretend that I don't hate this guy. And that for any specifics you have about what it was like being there with him and what it really felt like, there is just no way I can convince myself of that.
Chris:        So I'm going to let you know that I am very angry for the rest of this call.
Chris:        Like why would you-
Caller:        If it makes you happier about the making out, it was-
Chris:        Okay, say it, say it. What was it?
Caller:        I mean there were like, we would have sexually explicit AIM conversations. There was like AIM sexting.
Chris:        And for anybody... I assume everybody knows that AIM was like, I think G-Chat has replaced it. That's probably the closest analogy. And texting, texting has kind of, or WhatsApp.
Caller:        Right.
Chris:        So you're basically... in modern terms it would be called sexting with this guy who's in his 30s and who's married.
Caller:        Exactly. Right.
Chris:        So he is telling you all of these things, he is telling you all of these things that he wants to do and then you are getting over there and making out. And then you're saying, "Hey, no. We've got to stop.", and then he's going with that. Thank God.
Caller:        Yeah exactly.
Chris:        Aw, fuck this guy. Did he have to register as a sex offender when all of this went down?
Caller:        No, so he didn't.
Chris:        Oh, son of a bitch. I hope this motherfucker gets hit by lightning. I hope this guy... I hope this guy walks under a construction and a crane topples over at that moment. I got no stomach for this guy. This guy is a bad person and you can laugh all you want. I'm glad it didn't traumatize you... I hope... this guy should be registered.
Caller:        It was partly my, well I think that was partly... I think maybe that's part of what I'm thinking about this week, like was that the correct decision. Because I didn't, I cooperated with the school system and told them what was going on, but I decided not to press charges further than that or get him on any sort of registered list.
Caller:        And I was very... I turned him in but I was also very protective of him. And had I gone a little further I think he would have ended up on a sex registry. I don't know, I have mixed feelings about sex registries and-
Chris:        Here's a question that is a loaded question, but I want to know the answer. Do you know if he still works with kids?
Caller:        He does not work with kids but I know that he coaches his... so yeah, he has daughters and he coaches one of his daughter's sports team. But it's much younger, much, much younger. So I'm like ninety percent I think it's okay, I hope.
Chris:        Does his wife, his wife must know everything that went down.
Caller:        That's what I assume. That's what I assume, but I think he ended up getting off pretty easy. I learned through... I learned recently that the principal that was actually responsible for firing him, or charged with firing him, is close family friends with his family. So I don't know how much information ended up being divulged or what that situation was.
Chris:        So it was like Catholic church style. Catholic church style, handled behind closed doors.
Caller:        Yeah, exactly. Precisely. Precisely.
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        So yeah, I mean that was the last contact that I had with him over a decade ago. And the other day, I know that he lives in the same general area so I've always... for years I've just been kind of preparing myself for this moment, that I would run into him again. I'm like, "It's inevitable that we are going to run into him again." I have mutual friends who will be like, "Oh, I saw Mr. So and So at Walmart the other day."
Caller:        So I've known that he has been around and I've kind of figured that this would happen one day. And yeah, Starbucks. So, I just walked into this Starbucks on a weekend morning and it was crazy full and I was going there to get some work done and had my laptop with me, and I was looking around at the different tables to figure out what table I could snag. And I'm staring open, absentmindedly at this booth in the corner. I see this father and his two daughters sipping lemonade. And I'm like, "Oh, they are probably going to leave soon, I can swipe that booth."
Caller:        I'm just staring at him for a minute and then I realized that it was my former teacher.
Chris:        Did you say anything?
Caller:        My impulse was to go up and say hi, because I am awkward like that. I just love awkward situations, I don't know why. I am just really curious about people and enjoy awkward situations. And I also, I thought that... I don't know, like I said, I haven't felt very traumatized by it over the past few years and I kind of wanted him to know that we were cool at the end of the day I guess. And that I wish him well. So my impulse was to go and say hi but because he was with his daughters, I didn't want to bother him.
Caller:        But I wanted to let him know that he could come say hi to me if he wanted, and I didn't know if he had seen me. So I was just going to order just like a black coffee but I changed my order to a mocha so they would have to yell my name out in the Starbucks, to try to get his attention.
Caller:        But he left before they called my coffee out and he didn't turn around. So I didn't say hi to him there, but then I ended up shooting him a note on one of his social media profiles basically being like, "Hey, I think that was you at Starbucks. I don't know if you saw me but I didn't want to bother you and I won't bother you now, but I just wanted to let you know that it's good to see you are well and I wish you the best."
Caller:        And he ended up responding to that. And he ended up popping back over to Starbucks in the hour that followed, to say hello.
Chris:        He came back.
Caller:        He came back.
Chris:        Alone. Alone, without his daughters?
Caller:        Right, right.
Chris:        So what does he say?
Caller:        So he only had like five minutes and he talked at me for the five minutes. He said that I've been entirely too kind and too gracious and that... it was so surreal. It was one of those moments that is so surreal that you kind of are sitting there knowing it's happening but not capturing everything that's being said to you. So I don't remember exactly even the words that came out of his mouth, but something the effect of one of his recent church sermons recently being about turning the other cheek to your enemy. And he's like, "That's what I feel that you have been doing the past ten years and it's really kind of you." And he had also followed some of what I've been up to professionally over the past ten years, and said "You should be really proud of yourself. You've turned out to be such a wonderful young woman."
Caller:        He then told me about his kids, about his daughters, about his professional life. What he's been up to. And then he was like, "Well I'd love to talk more and id love to grab lunch-
Chris:        Are you kidding me?
Caller:        ... sometime if you are free." So I ended up-
Chris:        You're kidding?
Caller:        No.
Chris:        Did you get lunch with him?
Caller:        I got lunch with him, yeah.
Chris:        Is this real? Is this real?
Caller:        This is real. This is real. I promise you, this is real. Pinky promise, this is real.
Chris:        What happened on this lunch? Like a date. You go on a date with this fucking guy?
Caller:        Kind of. So seeing him at Starbucks was actually really nice because I felt like I really appreciated what he said and I felt that he kind of acknowledge that what he did was kind of weird and that I had been kind to him or whatnot. I accepted the lunch because I thought that he wanted to talk more in depth about that.
Caller:        But then it was the most surreal lunch because it was just talking to me like if I was just another former student. It was very catch up. Like, "What are you up to?" Giving me kind of career advice, just talking to me about everything other than the elephant in the room, kind of thing.
Chris:        So it never came up.
Caller:        No, it never came up. So then he kept messaging me afterwards and so this is what the current dilemma that I am in. He has been messaging me almost consistently since we caught up and since we saw each other.
Chris:        Is he still married?
Caller:        And then one of his-
Chris:        Is the guy still married?
Caller:        He is still married, yeah.
Chris:        I hate this guy so much. I'm going to ask you honestly. Like all sense of entertainment and any sense of this, and you know, this podcast is not even comedy and it hasn't been for a while. But any sense of entertainment aside, have you ever spoken to a professional about this situation?
Caller:        No, not about this one in particular.
Chris:        So you have seen a shrink but this never came up?
Caller:        No, I went to see a therapist for like five sessions once after a really bad breakup, that's it.
Chris:        Because I'm just going to be totally honest with you, and this one is breaking my heart, I'm just going to be totally honest with you and say, this is a married guy. He took advantage of you once, he's trying to snare you back into it. I don't know you, I don't know him, just based on what you've told me, just the fact that he would... what's going on here?
Chris:        And you've been laughing the whole time, I'm going to be honest, and say that you are laughing at a lot of times where I think anyone who is hearing you laughing would say, "No, that's a fucked up thing.", and you seem to laugh to cover up the fucked up side of it.
Chris:        And I got to say, I just got to put that on record. I just got to put that on record as somebody who cares about people and who's listening hard, is that this is not okay. And this guy-
Caller:        Sure.
Chris:        Is the messaging starting to get explicit again?
Caller:        No, the messaging is not explicit. So he... so this is what... this is what has been so weird for me, is I guess I'm realizing a lot of the reason I felt very forgiving and loving towards him all of these past years, is that that forgiveness has very much been predicated on the idea that he's felt really bad about it, that he's regretted it, that it was really difficult period in his life and he had to go through a lot, work through a lot of stuff and suffered consequences from it. So that is the image that I had built up in my mind. I didn't have contact with this guy for over a decade and I kind of pictured him going to marital counseling, losing his job, maybe going to therapy about that, doing a lot of introspection, feeling really bad.
Caller:        And so I guess during that lunch I was expecting him to say something to the extent that it was going to develop on what he said and today me at Starbucks, something to the extent of I cared a lot about you but I was inappropriate and I'm sorry for whatever I did. And I sort of feel like really I dodged a bullet in a lot of ways, but it doesn't mean it was okay to shoot the gun, you know?
Chris:        Yeah. Thank god, thank God it never progressed further than it did, thank God.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        But it still doesn't mean what happened was okay. I think you would agree, right? Like if it went further and if you'd lost your virginity to this guy, it would really be bad.
Caller:        Oh, one hundred percent
Chris:        I do have to say, the fact that he is messaging you again, he is falling back into it, and I just want... who knows, who knows. The fact that this guy is coaching any kids, this guy is around kids, this guy is demonstrating no remorse. He's trying to snare you back in on some level, what is going on? What is going on?
Caller:        So he... so in one of his messages, he messaged me pretty constantly, and he messaged me the other night I was just getting out of happy hour and going over to a friends house and had a few glasses of wine, and just didn't even know how to react to what he was saying, so I sort of brushed it off, but feel like I need to come back to it, or maybe just block him entirely.
Chris:        Wait a minute. So you are saying you went and got a glass of wine together? Is that what you said?
Caller:        No, no, no, no. He was messaging me and I'm receiving these messages after happy hour and I'd had three glasses of wine-
Chris:        Oh, okay. Okay.
Caller:        ... and I didn't know how to respond. And he said something to the effect of like, "It's really nice to have your voice back in my life." And I'm like, "Likewise."
Caller:        And I shouldn't even say likewise, but I'm just at this point where I am trying to brush him off nicely and move on with my life kind of thing. And he says something to the effect of... or I said I wasn't sure you would want me back in your life. And he goes, "Me too." And then he goes, "I was never angry or disappointed with you. Purely sympathetic. "
Chris:        The fuck does that mean? Sympathetic?
Caller:        That was my reaction. So I think at this point, and maybe it's fucked up, but up until he said that, I have felt so forgiving and generous, and like I felt like I have not been terribly scared by it. It was fucked up, but I think I was probably the only one, it was what it was. I am living my life, I'm happy. You seem like you're doing well. Let's go on our separate paths, we're all good.
Caller:        But then he is messaging me things and saying things like that.
Chris:        Yeah, as if he-
Caller:        What does that mean?
Chris:        Yeah, as if he did you some sort of favor. As if he was so understanding to you. Meanwhile, what does... even going back to the beginning, what book did you lend this grownup that you had to go back to his house and get it? Do you remember what the book was?
Caller:        It was... it was actually not a, it was less of book than a school project that we had to compile and he wanted to use mine as an example for his class. So I had kept my project and lent it back to him, and he had used it for the school year and then was giving it back to me.
Chris:        And he brought it to his home. Oh weird, he couldn't just keep it in school, he brought it to his home where you'd have to come get it. Oh how... weird.
Chris:        Because I tell you, I've known a lot or teachers in my life, I grew up with a lot of people that become teachers, and they are all super psyched and want to bring that shit home with them all the time. They are all... I'm being sarcastic! Nobody does that! Nobody is like, "Oh I love this thirteen year old's school work so much that I'm going to bring it home so I can fucking soak in it at home."
Chris:        Everybody I know who teaches hates it and prays for theirs breaks. They love affecting kids and they want to do the right thing, and then when that summer comes, the last thing they're doing is saying, "Oh, I'm gonna bring this thirteen year old's school project home with me because I just can't let it go."
Chris:        This guy is a bad guy.
Caller:        Totally normal.
Chris:        Oh god.
Chris:        You doing okay now though?
Caller:        Yeah I know. It like-
Chris:        You feeling better now? Doing okay?
Caller:        I'm fine. No, I'm doing... I'm just really in this weird space with this because this all running into him again is pretty recent. And I'm just in this weird space, like how I... I'm just debating how I detract myself from this now. Do I explain myself? Do I just block him? Do I have an in person conversation? Do I say like, "Hey, a lot of my forgiveness is predicated on the fact that you felt back but now you don't."
Caller:        But I'm just sort of in this place where I'm debating what, if anything I say to him and how I gently step away from the situation.
Chris:        So it's good. You want out, that's good. No more lunches. And I hope I'm not coming off as just, I really hope that I'm not coming off as judgemental, I really hope I am not. The only person I am judging in this is his, I promise, I promise. And I hope I haven't come off as judgemental to you at any point.
Caller:        No, not at all. It's completely normal judge. I mean I think that's been the weird part about being confronted with this again, but over a decade after the fact is now I am an adult and so now I view the situation differently than I did back at fifteen.
Caller:        Yeah, it's hard not to judge that kind of situation.
Chris:        Did you go to public school? What kind of school did you go to?
Caller:        Yeah it was a public school.
Chris:        And they're not required to report that shit? They're not required to put him on a list?
Chris:        This whole thing seems like a nightmare of how the system works sometimes.
Caller:        Yeah, I know. It really does. I don't know. I honestly think he was going to keep his job for a little while. After the whole thing came out, it was towards the end of the school year when I was graduating, and he was still on the role to start for the next year. A family friend of his happened to be someone that my Mom confided in, and she also worked at the same school, and I believe she was the one that ended up going into the principal's office when she saw that he was still teaching and was like, "I know what happened. This is really fucked up, he needs to be fired. I cannot work with this man."
Caller:        But I believe he was let go pretty quietly.
Chris:        Son of a Bitch. I don't like it. I don't like it at all
Caller:        I know, I know, it's so-
Chris:        I don't like that he just got to move on and then ten years later and he is saying to you, "I was really sympathetic to you actually."
Chris:        Oh, like he is going to pat you on the head. He's going to pat you on the head. This fucking guy.
Caller:        That's the thing, I guess that's just what has been turning my world around this past week is because I've just, I don't know, I kind of regret letting him back into my life. Curiosity got the cat, because I was just so curious to see where he was at and what he was up to. I don't know, it was a mistake because I think I liked the image that I had of him in my head, much better than the reality and the person that I had in front of me.
Chris:        Well yeah, because I would imagine he loses his job, you assume his life goes, you assume that he is going to suffer a little bit. You assume that his wife found out, you assume that he's never going to be allowed to do certain things and be around certain people again, and now you are finding out ten years later that might not be the case. He effectively may have gotten away with this.
Caller:        Yeah, exactly.
Chris:        That sucks, that sucks.
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, honestly I feel fine for myself, but it is those little questions of like should I have tried to get him on some sort of sex offender registry, or should he be coaching children in any capacity? I don't know.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        I like to think that now that whatever it's been... he's older now, and the kids that he is working with are even younger, so I would hope that it's a completely different context.
Chris:        Yeah, but I'm sure it brings up that thought. I'm sure seeing that he can just fucking chill out at a Starbucks is bringing up a lot of thoughts of, "Holy shit, wait what? What?"
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. And I'm a very forgiving person. Like I never wish harm on anybody, and I want him to be happy and I want him to be okay, but I just want him also to realize what he did.
Chris:        And are you, what is your-
Caller:        And I realized it was unthinkable.
Chris:        What's your life like now, what are the basics?
Caller:        My life is awesome, I love my life.
Chris:        That's good, that's great.
Caller:        I don't know, I'm trying to figure out what I can say without giving away too many... I don't know, I feel like I shouldn't talk about my life a lot because it would give away a lot of identifying details, but-
Chris:        That's fair.
Caller:        But my life is good.
Chris:        That's cool. I think the obvious question is do you feel like your relationships have been affected moving forward because as a kid some pretty specific stuff happened?
Caller:        Yeah, you know what's funny? I've never had an American boyfriend since, I've always dated foreign men.
Chris:        Wow, didn't see that answer coming.
Caller:        I think it's partly running away from that.
Chris:        So you may have self consciously written off trusting an entire nation.
Caller:        I have, I have. I've spent a lot of time in Europe. Yeah, I don't know, there's something, there's just something about American... which is just funny, most of the American men who have approached me or hit on me have been married men. Yeah, I don't know, I sort of... I don't know if it's related, but I think I have run away from all of that. So I've had lots of good relationships, good healthy relationships with foreign nationals.
Chris:        Okay, so you're feeling good about your life, you don't want to get too specific. It sounds like you do something cool that he congratulated on, and you can't get specific because it could give you away. That sounds cool.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
Chris:        So you're a world traveler with a good career. Everything turned out okay and thank God for that because I'll tell you what, I think we've done about fifty of these things, I don't know if I've ever been angrier during the course of a call then I was during the course of your call.
Caller:        I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get your blood pressure going.
Chris:        No, no, you don't have to apologize for anything. I will tell you there is this... because I am like an artist, and I'm a pretty sensitive guy, but every once in a while I'll hear something, and it will just be a reminder that I am a North Jersey dude at the end of the day and my instinct is to find this guy and break his jaw. That's my instinct. Is find out who this man is and break his jaw.
Caller:        I totally get. I totally understand that. And it's funny because if I were sitting in your seat I would feel the exact same way. It's interesting, I feel like sometimes we're able to accept things for themselves that we wouldn't accept for other people.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        And I feel like if this happened to my best friend I would be completely outraged. Honestly I feel okay personally, but-
Chris:        Well can I ask you the hardest question?
Caller:        Oh yeah.
Chris:        Can I ask you the hardest question?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Because you said-
Caller:        Of course.
Chris:        ... you just said there's things that we feel okay about happening to ourselves that we'd be livid if they happened to other people, what are you going to do if you find out this guy, if it was a pattern? You know? What happens then?
Caller:        If I found out it was a pattern, I think I would be much more... well that's the question. What would I do now? I would be inspired to take action in some way, shape or form. I would probably immediately get him off any sort of organization that had anything to do with children. If there was some sort of case against him I would certainly speak. I would do that in defense of someone else. Which maybe sounds a little fucked up if I'm like well if I was the only one it's okay, but if I am, and I was the only one, I do feel like it's not worth ruining his life over.
Chris:        Yeah, because it is interesting, like you said.
Caller:        But yeah, if it did involve someone-
Chris:        Yeah, because you did say that you've spent all this time assuming he learned his lesson in a big way and only in the past recent times has that been called into question. So it is one of those things, where if he learned his lesson, ultimately I'm fine, lets walk away.
Chris:        But I'm sure that thought's crossed your mind before, of just praying that oh God, this guy, this guy.
Caller:        Yeah. Exactly. And I do, yeah, I'm like ninety percent convinced that I was the only one. There's that ten percent doubt in my mind, but it was so emotional that it did feel more like a... that means that he obviously can be sexually or emotionally attracted to women of that age.
Caller:        There could have been someone after me, why not? But I don't know, yeah. I hope that there was no one else, I don't think there was anyone else. And if I were to find out something to the contrary, then I would defend that girl, but hopefully that's not the case.
Chris:        Yeah, I hope so too. I hope so too. I also, like I said, hope that, although he has to two daughters so I don't want to wish ill on a family, but in a vacuum I wish that a boulder would roll off a cliff. Maybe since he has two daughters I don't wish death upon him, but I wish real serious bad things. I don't want to wish death on anybody, I don't want to make jokes about that but oh God. Oh God.
Caller:        Thank you.
Chris:        I live in New York, I get on the subway and there are high school kids. God forbid you got to go on a subway between two thirty and three thirty pm in New York City when high school lets out, there's never a part of me that looks up and is like, "Yowza, look at that girl" Never.
Chris:        Anytime I am on a subway car with high school kids here's what I'm thinking, "Time to fucking time to switch cars.", because I don't want to hear these kids yelling all the time because I am getting old.
Chris:        Kids, kids. Kids, man.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        And this guy went to school on how to work with kids and in some world... Here's what I can do, here's what I can do because I can stress out with you and I can stress about you, but here's another thing I can do, is if in some fucking world this guy ever hears this, I want you to know that I'm not the one you put in the middle of it and I'm not the one you confused, and you're a fucking bad person deep down. I hope he hears that. I'm allowed to say that. I wasn't there. You can have all the emotional reactions in the world, I'm allowed to say it.
Chris:        I hope this guy hears it. I hope this guy hears it and I hope he knows that he really did wrong. I hope he knows he did wrong.
Caller:        Thank you, thank you. Yeah, it's weird, I feel like these cases are more and more in the news though too right? Like in... there's... I don't know where I'm going with that but I feel like I hear about this stuff more and more, inappropriate teacher/student relationships brought about by like more communication on social media and girls maybe acting more mature than their age or guys. And yeah, I don't know, I mean...
Chris:        Remember that famous one to? Who was that lady? What was the lady's name, we got to look this up. Who was the one that actually worked out for like 30 years? I want to... there's a name popping into my head. If it's okay I'm just going to... was that her name?
Caller:        I don't know.
Chris:        Wait, hold on. I don't want to say the wrong name. Oh yeah, Mary Kay Letourneau, right? That was the one? Yeah, she dated that kid.
Caller:        I don't know, I haven't heard of that one.
Chris:        Yeah, she dated a kid, and he was really young and then I think it actually worked out. I think they have kids and stuff, I think that one actually worked out, turned out kind of okay, Mary Kay Letourneau. But I still can't get behind that one. Yeah.
Caller:        Well the current, you know the front runner for the French Presidential election right now, he is married to his high school English teacher I think. They met when he was fourteen.
Chris:        Did they get together when he was fourteen?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        No, oh God. Oh God.
Caller:        I believe so, you will have to Google that to fact check me but they got together when he was pretty young.
Chris:        Oh God, that's not okay.
Caller:        But that's France, so that's a different context.
Chris:        Well, there a million easy jokes about France wrapped up in that one, and I am just going to walk in the other direction. Because I don't know if we got a lot of French listeners but if we do, Bon Jour, and I'm not making easy jokes at your expense. Au Revoir.
Chris:        I really, I don't know, I got to say, I got to say, I don't want to put it on you, I don't want to assume anything, but you always laugh when I'm talking about the most fucked up shit and it makes me feel like there's unresolved stuff there and I hope you resolve it. I hope you resolve it.
Caller:        I'm a very giggly person, I laugh way too much.
Chris:        But you have to admit, when you listen back to this you are going to be like, "Every time it got really tense you burst out laughing." And I get, but who... I mean that's my whole thing, I feel like all I've ever learned from my parents, every bad thing, you learn to just fucking laugh. You have to, you have to. So in a sense I think that's very good.
Caller:        You have to.
Chris:        You have to.
Caller:        I'd never been able to survive my twenties ifI hadn't learned how to laugh.
Chris:        Was this guy your first kiss? Was he your first kiss?
Caller:        No. No, no, no.
Chris:        Oh thank God, oh good. Oh good.
Caller:        My first my kiss a couple months prior to him and I was very grateful for that.
Chris:        How old was that guy?
Caller:        My first kiss?
Chris:        Yeah, I'm hoping he was... I'm hoping he was... I'm hoping you're not lie, "Oh yeah, he was even older."
Caller:        No, no, no. I was fourteen, and he was seventeen.
Chris:        All right. Even that is weird. I remember-
Caller:        Do you know what he did to me? He told me... how much time do we have? Are we about up?
Chris:        A minute and twenty seconds.
Caller:        Oh, okay. So my first kiss was seventeen but then he told me he couldn't date me because he was part of a gang, and my life might be in danger if we were to go out.
Chris:        You're kidding me? I once made out with a girl in New York City and she called me the next day and said she had an ex in the Mafia and he would kill me. I had the same thing.
Caller:        No, no. What the hell?
Chris:        What?
Caller:        What kind of excuse is that?
Chris:        We both made out with gang land murders. No, that girl wasn't a murderer. I've always wanted to ask that girl, I remember she said, I think she texted me, she was like, "I really like you but I don't think I can see you. I have an ex in the Mafia and he might hurt you." And you know what I wrote back? I just said, "I must be a very bad kisser." I said, "I must be a very bad kisser if you're making up..."-
Caller:        Maybe she dated my ex boyfriend.
Chris:        Maybe, who knows. Who knows. All right we've got 20 seconds left. I'm going to go take a couple deep breaths, take a walk around the block because this one got me mad.
Caller:        I will let you do that. Thank you for listening.
Chris:        Of course. Do other people in your life get really mad or am I the only one that gets really mad when I hear about this?
Caller:        No, other people in my life get very, very mad. I let everybody else get mad for me.
Chris:        That's nice.
Caller:        It's not very nice, it's kind of selfish.
Chris:        Caller, that one made my head spin. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope that my reactions didn't weird you out in any way. I was very nervous about coming off as judgemental in any way but I just found myself getting very upset at the circumstances you described, so that was an intense one. We go there sometimes, we go there, we go there and I hope everybody out there learned a little listening to it or has their opinions in order. And that's it. Thank you Caller for calling.
