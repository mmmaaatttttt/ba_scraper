Chris:        Hey, this is Gethard. How are you?
Caller:        Hey. What's up?
Chris:        Nothing much.
Caller:        Just a second. I'm in a weird hallway right now. Am I echo-y?
Chris:        No, I think you're pretty good. They'll let me know. I don't really have the authority to answer that, but I just got the thumbs up on it. You sound good.
Caller:        Awesome. How are you?
Chris:        I'm good. So just remember, you can hang up at any point you want if it gets uncomfortable or you got to go. But I can't hang up for an hour. So you get up to an hour. If you want to hang up, feel free.
Caller:        Awesome.
Chris:        Alright, so-
Caller:        So I can Baba Booey for 45 minutes?
Chris:        In what sense? In what sense are you Baba Booey, AKA Gary Dell'Abate? The Howard Stern Show.
Caller:        No, I mean just the "baba booey, baba booey"?
Chris:        Oh, yeah. If you just want to heckle me, basically heckle me on the phone for an hour, I have to just endure it. Yeah. Or we can have a conversation. It's up to you.
Caller:        Yeah. We can have a conversation.
Chris:        Okay. Yeah. So what are we talking about?
Caller:        I don't know. I'm at work. I just took a 30-minute break in my car. I walked back in and then I got through, so going back outside to skip some more time.
Chris:        Yeah. I was just going to say you work at a job where you can apparently sit in your car for 30 minutes and then also just talk to me for an hour?
Caller:        Yeah. I just ... Nobody's here for Thanksgiving.
Chris:        So you're just doing whatever you want?
Caller:        I do customer service for accounts payable.
Chris:        How is that? How do you like that?
Caller:        Oh, it's the worst, Chris.
Chris:        Yeah. It sounds like it. I didn't want to be judgmental, but it sounds awful. I mean you have a job where it sounds like you're hiding in your car. It sounds like you ... When you say you took a break and sat it your car, that to me sounds like a person who is not thrilled with the situation.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So you're escaping. You're looking for active escape.
Caller:        Yeah. I'm looking for escape.
Chris:        Some of it sitting in your car, being on the phone with me, anything you can do to not be working at this shop.
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        Okay. So how temporary is this? How much is this? This is your thing right now.
Caller:        I don't know.
Chris:        You don't know.
Caller:        It should be ... It's been a year that I've been doing this.
Chris:        And when you started, was it a situation where you're like, "Maybe this will be alright. Maybe this will be a thing"? Or were you like, "I'm going to do this. I'm chasing something else"?
Caller:        Yeah. It was just, "Oh, that pays enough. I'll start on that."
Chris:        We all got to take those gigs sometimes.
Caller:        Yeah. But it is the sense of being trapped and ... If I say I need to have enough saved, am I ever going to have enough saved?
Chris:        Yeah. It's a huge question.
Caller:        It's going to be another excuse.
Chris:        A lot of ... So you say another excuse. Are you somebody who's made a bunch of excuses in the past?
Caller:        Yeah. I feel like I spend a lot of time not doing things and then go too big.
Chris:        Oh, that's interesting. So, I got a couple questions. You say, "Am I ever going to save enough?" What are you saving for? Is that save for a house or is that save to give yourself a year of freedom? Is that save to go see the world? What are you saving for?
Caller:        To save just to be like, "Alright, I've got six months saved that I don't have to worry about." I wouldn't have to work, or something.
Chris:        So you want to buy yourself some time. And then you say you spend a lot of time not doing things. That sounds like it ties in. What are the things you're not doing?
Caller:        I don't ... Got to that, take those improv classes. Go hang out. I feel like I've wasted the last year.
Chris:        You've wasted a year and it's starting to freak you out a little bit.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.
Chris:        But even when I say, "What are the things?", you don't quite-
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You don't really even know what the things are.
Caller:        I'm generally uncertain about everything.
Chris:        You kind of have a dream to have some dreams.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        Man, that's a ... I don't want to be judgmental. I'm not trying to be judgmental. I say this with love. That's a grim place to be.
Chris:        You have a vague dream of pursuing something.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That's a tough one. That's a tough spot. So how do we work on this?
Caller:        I don't know. I don't know, Chris. I think I've probably been drinking too much, smoking too much weed.
Chris:        Yeah. Self-medicating, they call that.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Hiding. You're hiding. You don't like what's going on and you're hiding.
Caller:        Yeah. No, I feel like that's been a lot of my life lately is hiding and putting things off and getting a glimpse of, "Oh, yeah, that's something."
Chris:        What's the glimpse? Tell me about the glimpse. I can't hear that and not wonder what the glimpse is. What are these moments where you're like, "This could be it. I feel it. I feel this being the thing I've been looking for"? What's the glimpse?
Caller:        A few months ago, I met a girl that was teaching special education, and that is something I'd talked about. And then, she said that like, "Oh, they always need tough guys to hold them down." And I was like, "Oh, that sounds like a perfect job."
Chris:        Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        She said-
Caller:        Is there a lot going on there?
Chris:        Yeah. I'll tell you on my end that I left my headphones on, but I reached under to ... It sounded to me like you said that a special education teacher said she needs a tough guy to hold them down referring to the kids.
Caller:        Yeah, that they're always looking-
Chris:        And you said that would be a perfect job.
Caller:        Yeah because I feel like when I look at my life and the things that have defined it, the big, definite ... I think the big thing I always come back to is my interaction with mental illness and other people and just weirdos. And being attracted to that.
Chris:        Okay. That's fascinating.
Caller:        I don't know if that's what-
Chris:        So you crave ... Do you-
Caller:        ... if that's the appropriate way to refer to special education kids.
Chris:        No. Hey, listen.
Caller:        What?
Chris:        It's okay. And the fact that you said you don't if it's appropriate, I don't know if it's appropriate, either. But I think everybody who's listening to this probably hears you processing through this and understands you're not judging. You're not say-
Caller:        I say it with love.
Chris:        Yeah, and also, it sounds to me ... Here's the main thing I'll say. If you're in a customer service job where you're hiding in the car, it sounds to me like you probably identify as an outsider. You probably identify as an underdog.
Chris:        What we're really saying here is that you root for the underdog, and that you see maybe special education kids naturally as outsiders and underdogs, and that the idea of working in that world appealed to you because you felt some identification there.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.
Chris:        That's probably the longer, fleshed-out way to say it as we say it on our feet, but I don't think you're insensitive.
Caller:        No.
Chris:        So, a woman basically proposed that you be basically what sounds like being a bouncer in a special education environment.
Caller:        Yeah, well-
Chris:        And why didn't you jump on it? If that had appealed to you-
Caller:        Well, it wasn't a job offer. It was something I'd thought about, and she just talked to me more about the details.
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        And the details were like, "Oh, that'd be an actual physically engaging."
Chris:        I'm a little confused. So, was the appeal to be a special education teacher or is there a specific position where you are physically responsible for stopping out-of-control kids?
Caller:        That comes with being a special education teacher.
Chris:        But that's the part that you brought up that appealed to you.
Caller:        That's the part that kind of dinged that was like, "Alright."
Chris:        The actual, physical wrestling of the kids.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Wow. It's a very specific of that world to have the utmost appeal.
Caller:        Yeah, and I feel like maybe there aren't a lot of people going in for that reason.
Chris:        To specifically ... Wait, I have to ask. I'm not judging. I'm just processing here.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        That was the specific part of not necessarily-. Not that I'd necessarily get to teach or enlighten these kids, but that there's an element of physical control that needs to happen.
Caller:        Yeah. An element of physical engagement. That was the thing that was like, "Alright." I didn't know. I didn't know that.
Chris:        I didn't either.
Caller:        When I thought about this before-
Chris:        I'm flabbergasted.
Caller:        When I thought about this before and thought, "Oh, that's something I'd be good at," she's like, "Oh, they always need strong guys. Sometimes you need to hold down autistic kids." And it was like, "Oh, okay."
Caller:        She said they've got a big bean bag that, if a kid's acting up, they just drop a heavy bean bag on them and hold them down.
Chris:        And that's the part you like? That's the specific-
Caller:        It sounded ... It made it a lot more intriguing.
Chris:        So what do we gotta do to get you there?
Caller:        Right?
Chris:        What do I got to do on this phone call? What do I got to do in the next 49 minutes and 28 seconds to get you to be someone who's not hiding in your car then going home and smoking weed all night and being the type of kid that's dropping the big bean bag on the autistic kids?
Caller:        Yeah. I just got to start moving.
Chris:        But how many ... I'll ask you this, and this might get a little ... This might put you in a weird headspace. How many days ... How many ... What percentage of days would you say you say some version of, "I got to get moving"?
Caller:        Most days.
Chris:        Most days.
Caller:        I'd say my internal monologue to myself is usually some form of, "I need to be exercising. I should be meditating. I should be going to therapy. I should be applying to more jobs."
Chris:        There's a whole checklist of things you need to be doing that you're just opting to not get to.
Caller:        Yeah, and a whole checklist of things that I'm like, "Oh, I know." If I get up and meditate for 10 minutes in the morning, that week's a completely different week.
Chris:        It's a better day. It's a better day. It's a better week. It's momentum.
Caller:        Yeah, and just ... Yeah. It's all about momentum, and I'm kind of self-sabotaging myself.
Chris:        You're stopping your own momentum.
Caller:        And I ... Yeah. And I think it's because I'm aware enough of it, that makes me feel like, "Oh, well I have control. I'm aware. I'm aware of the mistakes I'm making."
Chris:        So, let me ask you this because this feels a little ... I'm starting to feel a little ... I'm starting to realize something that's maybe making me feel a little bit of pressure. Feels like this-
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        Feels like this phone call-
Caller:        Is this becoming therapy?
Chris:        Well, it feels like this phone call is you taking one of the actions you say you don't usually take.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        So I feel some responsibility to effect permanent change via this phone call.
Caller:        Yeah, that'd be nice. I don't want to put that pressure on you.
Chris:        No, I'll step up. I'll do my best. Okay, here's my first question. How much ...
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        You said you wanted to save six months. How much do you really have saved right now? What do I got to do to get you to never walk back into that office again? What do I got to do?
Caller:        Well, right now I've got-
Chris:        What do I got to do to get you to get back in your car on this phone call and drive away from that office you hate while on this phone call?
Caller:        Oh, I don't ... I've got $300 in savings.
Chris:        Nevermind.
Caller:        I've got $3000 in my 401(k).
Chris:        And is that ... Can you access that without penalty?
Caller:        It's a 30% tax, or 25%.
Chris:        Okay. Yeah, nevermind. Okay. Yeah, no, we can't do that.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah, no. Nevermind.
Caller:        Because I had ... This is the thing, Chris.
Chris:        Okay, yeah. I like that you keep using the power play of saying my name even though I don't know your name. Well done. And I don't want to know your name. This is anonymous. But it's a power move. It's nice.
Caller:        I felt like immediately I was going to be saying my name-
Chris:        I don't need to know your name.
Caller:        But ...
Chris:        So, you're someone who's well aware that there's all these things you could be doing that would give you a life that you would enjoy more. Why do you not ... Why do you stop those things? What is that makes you feel like you don't deserve those things?
Caller:        I don't know the answer to that question. I don't know if I feel I don't deserve nice things, but I think I put myself in a position where I know I won't get those things. Is it a fear of failure?
Chris:        That's a great question.
Caller:        But, yeah. I had ... I had about $3000 saved. I'd taken a week off work and the plan was just to get ready to quit, look for other jobs, kind of part-time things. And then, the day of my vacation, my car broke down and all my savings went into fixing the car.
Chris:        That sucks.
Caller:        Just so I could have it to keep going back to work.
Chris:        Well, I tell you, I once read a very fascinating book all about the nature of poverty. And it said one of the cut-and-dry things is that it's not a mystery. One of the very cut-and-dry things is that people's cars suck up all their money.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        It's not an uncommon thing to be a slave to your car so you can get to a job just to sustain. It is a very sad and scary place to be.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        It's a bummer. I'm sorry that happened.
Caller:        I knew when I was doing it, like, "I'm blowing my savings to fix this car to go back to the job I was going to quit."
Chris:        That's horrible. So you had a week where it was go time, Operation Get the Fuck Out. And it instead became "Pray that the mechanic doesn't say that this costs more money. Oh, wait. He said it costs even more money." And it instead becomes Operation Go Back to Work.
Caller:        Yeah, and it was ... I got it fixed, and it broke down again. And I was like, "Oh, it's spark plugs and whatever the fuck."
Chris:        That sucks. So, here's a question I have.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        You sat in your car for half an hour today.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        We've now been on the phone-
Caller:        Eating yogurt and a banana.
Chris:        Eating yogurt. You sit in your car eating yogurt and ... Eating yogurt and bananas.
Chris:        We've now been on the phone for over 17 additional minutes. This is 47 minutes that you're not working. Sounds to me like you're not concerned at all about getting in trouble.
Caller:        No, I've ... There was a point and it's still kind of ongoing since the summer of trying to get fired.
Chris:        Okay, so you're actively trying to get fired.
Caller:        And it just doesn't happen.
Chris:        Okay. So then-
Caller:        Yeah, of actively shirking responsibilities.
Chris:        You've found that they-
Caller:        And then that makes it ... That feels worse.
Chris:        It does. It feels worse. You don't feel like you're getting away with something. You don't feel like you're sticking it to the man.
Caller:        You're not holding me to a very high standard.
Chris:        So you feel like you're existing in a purgatory. You're in a purgatory of sorts.
Caller:        Yeah, no. I've talked to my friend, and she quit last year, that, "Oh, this is purgatory."
Chris:        So you're in a job where you can not work, as long as you clock in. As long as you clock in, you get paid. But that's all you get. And if you just wander the halls eating yogurt, okay.
Caller:        Yeah, I wander the halls. I go to the exercise room.
Chris:        There's an exercise room.
Caller:        I kind of ... Yeah, it's a stationary bike and two free weights.
Chris:        So you ... This is like a ... You're living in a Camus novel.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        This is like an existentialist "You just exist."
Caller:        I think I would have pronounced that "Camus," right?
Chris:        Camus. I mean I completely could be wrong. I'm white trash from New Jersey.
Caller:        No, I think you're right. He is French.
Chris:        I'm pretty certain he's French. Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah, I'm existing in a Kafka-esque labyrinthian bureaucracy.
Chris:        A world where there's no consequences.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You're pushing buttons and you don't even know what the buttons do.
Caller:        Yeah. There's no rewards, and there's no punishments.
Chris:        So here's something that's occurring to me. There's things you want to be doing and researching and finding out about seeing if they're options. Is there no world in which the last 47 minutes that you've been eating yogurt and talking to me could've been spent just doing those things on your company's time?
Caller:        Yeah. I do that sometimes. A lot of it turns into ... I try to make the goal to apply to one job I'd actually like a day, but then that got a little exhausting. I couldn't keep it up every day.
Chris:        So you were trying to find opportunities that would be more fulfilling and it got ... It made you tired? It got too exhausting?
Caller:        Yeah. Just every day ... Yeah.
Chris:        I like you, man.
Caller:        I like you, too.
Chris:        I like you. I think you're going to find your way out of this.
Caller:        Yeah. It'll happen eventually.
Chris:        Can I ask how you got here? Because we're talking about how to find our way out of it but we haven't really talked about ... I don't know how old you are. I don't know anything about you.
Chris:        What ... Where ... Because sounds to me like this is a situation that you wound up in, that you didn't ... You weren't aiming for this.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So you got sidetracked and then stuck here.
Caller:        Yeah. I didn't plan on like, "Oh, I'm going to accounts. I'm going to do customer service for accounts payable companies."
Chris:        So how'd you wind up there? And I love the way you say that. I love just with the blunt recognition. There's something really beautiful to me about a guy who works hard, a hard working guy, a working-class guy who knows in one sentence that he can say, "I didn't plan on doing customer service for accounts payables companies."
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So you know you wound up in this somewhat ridiculous situation. Where does it start? Not even thinking about the job. Where does it start? Where do you come from? How do you grow up? What are you thinking about when you're in school? Do you go to college? Do you go ...
Chris:        How does it all lead to this? How does it all lead to this where we have this chance to talk? And this is what you're telling me about?
Caller:        So, where do you want me to start?
Chris:        The beginning. We got 40 minutes. We got 39 minutes.
Caller:        The beginning of my life?
Chris:        Yes. I want to hear about the beginning of your life. Because if this is what you're talking about, if the thing that we get to talk about ... If we get on the phone and what you want to talk about is this job and how to get out of it, I need to know the background on this.
Caller:        Alright. I'm going to have some good shit for you, Chris.
Chris:        Yeah, man.
Chris:        Okay, the beginning. Take me back to the beginning. Give me the good shit, dog.
Caller:        Alright. I was born in Lake Jackson, Texas. I guess you can track me down from that.
Chris:        I'm not going to.
Caller:        Yeah, I know.
Chris:        I'm not going to stalk you. I promise.
Caller:        I realize that. And I spend most of my time at work in the 'Chris Gethard Show' chat rooms.
Chris:        Okay.
Caller:        You could figure it out.
Chris:        Okay. Well now you're giving away too much. Now you're giving away too much. It's okay. It's fine. No, it's not.
Caller:        The doctor that delivered me, I believe, was Ron Paul.
Chris:        What?
Caller:        Ron Paul, the Libertarian.
Chris:        Yeah, Rand Paul's father, the-
Caller:        Yeah, he was the OBGYN and the Congressman of the district I'm from.
Chris:        And so, you're ... I'm just getting overwhelmed here, but I'm loving this. So you come into the world ... I ask you about the beginning of your life and the answer is that you were delivered into the world by rabble-rousing outsider politician Ron Paul. It's a beautiful start, beautiful start. Keep going. I don't want to stop this train.
Caller:        That was the beginning.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Well, I'm ... I will just add this to that day. When I was born, my mom had been in prison, and they let her out of prison to have me.
Chris:        Wow. Huge.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So, again. Easy for me. I'm a white guy living in New York City. Easy for me to laugh. But this is genuine here.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Some deficits from the start that you've had to fight through, so kudos to you. Kudos to you.
Caller:        So, I was raised by my grandparents.
Chris:        Before we move on, and if it's not comfortable, you don't have to share it, but can I ask what your mom was in prison for?
Caller:        Mostly drugs and the types of things she'd do to get drugs.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah.
Caller:        Like theft and stuff.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah. I got a lot of friends who've gone down that road.
Caller:        Yeah. It's just that kind of cycle.
Chris:        Okay. So, Ron Paul delivers you. Your mom is sent back-
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        Your mom is sent back to the jail. Your mom is sent back to the clink.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Grandparents raise you.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Is there anger there? When you're a kid, is there anger? Is there confusion?
Caller:        I don't remember being angry then. I'd say I know now, and I realize more, I do have a lot of anger.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Wouldn't be shocking that it comes from a lot of that. But, as a kid, I remember it being mostly like, "Oh, this is just ... I don't know any different."
Chris:        Fair. Yeah, and that's a beautiful thing about childhood. It sounds to me like right off the bat you're saying that. It sounds like your grandparents were pretty rad.
Caller:        Yeah. No, they were great. I think they did a great job.
Chris:        They let you be a kid, which is a thing that you might not have had.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        Do you remember any ... Do you remember positive ... Your grandparents ever throw you just a really great birthday party or anything that stands out where you're like, "They were great"?
Caller:        Yeah. I think every day, they tried to overdo it.
Chris:        Oh, okay. So they were-
Caller:        If anything, I had kind of a too good of a childhood. They did their best to overcompensate every way they could.
Chris:        Because they probably want-
Caller:        For that situation.
Chris:        They want to make sure you don't miss out on having a mom. They probably also have some guilt about "Our daughter wound up in prison."
Caller:        Yeah. "Our daughter fucked up."
Chris:        So let's make sure this kid has everything.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Okay. So let's keep going through this.
Caller:        Where are we going? Just from childhood up?
Chris:        Well, listen, if it's on me, my job here is to get numbers, baby. You go to remember this, okay? I'm all about this honest conversation. I'm also a businessman, and my job is to get numbers. And I said tell me about your childhood.
Chris:        The first thing you told me, first two things: Ron Paul delivered me, my mom was in prison. Okay. I can feel the numbers going through the roof. So if you're down to keep talking, childhood thus far, you've been shooting three-pointers and nailing them, my friend.
Chris:        As far as the fascination factor, this is fascinating. Small-town Texas kid born to an imprisoned mom by Ron Paul. I want to hear more.
Caller:        So, I can go to a lot of places. Alright. Now, I didn't ... Now, I know my dad now. We have a pretty good relationship.
Chris:        That's good.
Caller:        I did not know who my dad was until I was 14.
Chris:        14. Okay.
Caller:        There was a kind of a different guy I thought was my dad, some balding, redheaded redneck.
Chris:        So, you thought your dad was some redneck. Sounds like a person you're not thrilled about being your dad as a child.
Caller:        Well, I only met him once, but yeah.
Chris:        So you met a guy once and thought he was your dad and it was a bummer.
Caller:        Yeah, it was just kind of like, "Well, we think this guy is your dad. Your mom was married to him when she had you."
Chris:        Oh, okay.
Caller:        But, my dad was the guy my mom was married to before that. They got married in high school in Montana, moved down to Texas, got divorced, then hooked up 10 years later at the fair.
Chris:        At the fair.
Caller:        Yeah, at the fair.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        And then, that's where I came from. I was a carnival baby.
Chris:        Hold on. You got to give me permission to laugh at the phrase "carnival baby."
Caller:        Oh, yeah. Of course.
Chris:        Because this is a very personal ... Thank you so much. This is a personal and there's a lot of grim details to it, but you can't use the phrase "I was a carnival baby" and not expect me to laugh a little bit.
Caller:        Yeah, no.
Chris:        Now when you say they hooked up at the fair, do you mean they saw each other at the fair, remembered their old flame, went back to one or the other's house, and had a night of lovemaking to remember the old times? Or are you saying ran into each other at the fair, and then behind the fucking Gravitron, you get conceived?
Caller:        I think it's more the latter.
Chris:        You think you were conceived at the fair?
Caller:        I talked to my brother about this recently, about grilling my dad on it and getting my answer.
Chris:        Please. Because I don't want to be crass. I'm not trying to be insensitive, but you're telling me your perception you were conceived behind a corn dog stand?
Caller:        Yeah. I imagined in the bathroom, but I don't know.
Chris:        Fair. But in the bathroom at a fair, that's probably a Porta-Potty, right?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Man, you have had to think hard about the circumstances of your conception, more than almost anybody I've ever met.
Caller:        Yeah. Well, knowing the detail and piecing it together, it's kind of like, "Well, I hope it's a better story if it's at the fair."
Chris:        So you do want it to be a good story. It sounds like you got good grandparents. You got ... Your brother a good guy? You close with your brother?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So you got a good support net here where you're able to talk about this stuff and it's not ...
Caller:        Yeah. I talk about it with my ... Me, my brother, and stepmom had conversations of like, "Do y'all think it's at the fair?"
Chris:        So you got a stepmom. So you're back in touch with your dad to that degree?
Caller:        Yeah. We got back in touch and, almost immediately, he tried to take credit for the kid he didn't know about. So, it's been-
Chris:        Oh, in a way you respect or in a way ... Did you ...
Caller:        Yeah, it's been ...
Chris:        He stepped up.
Caller:        I think it's ... Yeah, it's as good of a relationship as it could have ended up being.
Chris:        Yeah, for a 14-year absence, he got in there as best he could.
Caller:        I've been asking him to buy me a car. He could step up there, Chris.
Chris:        Yeah, he could.
Caller:        But ...
Chris:        He's not into that.
Caller:        Yeah, it's not that bad.
Chris:        Again, if you don't want to share, I don't know how old you are. Feels to me like if you're in your twenties, I could see him buying you the car. Are you out of your twenties, or are you in your twenties?
Caller:        I'm just turning 27.
Chris:        27. Alright. So right on the cusp where he's probably like, "I could buy a car. I could-
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Interesting.
Caller:        But he also probably feels like, "Come on. You can figure it out."
Chris:        Yeah, and there's some validity to that.
Caller:        Three years to 30.
Chris:        There's some validity to that, right?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So, okay. So, born, Ron Paul brings you into the world. Your mom sent back to prison. Nine months earlier, she had an affair, rekindled an old flame. You grew up, grandparents overcompensating. You might in a little bit of a bubble. 14, you meet your dad. Things are there.
Chris:        Okay, that's the beginning of high school. What's next? What's next?
Caller:        I went to college. I got a history degree. I got teacher certification, and I was just kind of like, "Ah, fuck it."
Chris:        Wow, okay. So is this where the self-sabotage really starts?
Caller:        Yeah. It's probably around then, yeah.
Chris:        That's when it starts to become actual life decisions.
Caller:        Yeah. I feel like in college, it was a good structure for me because even if I had my criticisms of it, I knew, "Well, get the paper done. Do this. Move forward in this way." I had the structure that a hyper ADHD kid probably needs.
Chris:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Caller:        And then I kind of got out and was like, "Well, I don't want to teach history at a middle school or something."
Chris:        Yeah, why history? Why history?
Caller:        I liked it.
Chris:        Yeah. Any particular period of history? Any focus? Or just history in general?
Caller:        Yeah. I like modern history, kind of World War I to present. Global politics and current events. Those kind of things. I think I mainly switched my major to history because of something. I realized that I was a big fan of Lost, Wookieepedia, Star Wars, things.
Caller:        And I'd spend so much time-
Chris:        Wait. What? How does liking Star Wars lead to you being a history major? I'm sorry I interrupted, but you have a real good ability to just slip in things that are really making me so happy.
Chris:        Wookieepedia. The word "Wookieepedia" was said. I didn't see that coming at all. That blindsided me. I apologize for interrupting. So how does that lead to you being a history major?
Caller:        I realized, especially with developing an encyclopedic of Lost and things like that, I was kind of like, "Well, I know I can do-
Chris:        Your brain is built that way. Yeah.
Caller:        "I know I can do this. I know I can store these facts and go way overboard correcting people on these made up universes."
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        "I know at least I can do well in the same structure, but with real things."
Chris:        Right. So you can memorize details about battles, about strategies, about planning and what went into periods in between wars. And if somebody writes a paper and says, "Tell us all about the landing at Inchon in Korea," if that's how you pronounce that. I'm dumb.
Caller:        Yeah, I don't know
Chris:        You can spit all that out. You can research that, and you can retain that, and you can break it down, and you can tell that story back to that person.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Yeah. That's cool.
Caller:        But something I realized I can ... If I'm going to get through college, that's one thing I can see being good at.
Chris:        That's true.
Caller:        I know I can get by. And if it's something I'm interested in, it's easy.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        I can do it.
Chris:        So you get the history degree. You realize maybe a history degree is not the most practical, easy thing to practically apply. You get a teaching degree. Feels like a very good background, or like a very good next step. Decide you don't want to teach history. You don't want to go into a middle school, like you said.
Chris:        Okay. So you've made some decisions there on what you don't want to do. And how does it lead to ... I assume you graduated around 22, 23. That's when most people graduate.
Caller:        Yeah. 22.
Chris:        Now we're four to five years later. What are the decisions between then and now? Because you decided what you didn't want to do and now, it's five years later, and you still don't know what you do want to do.
Caller:        Yes. Well, I got out of school and I was living in a trailer park. My friend that moved into the trailer next to me, she was working at this company. Right?
Caller:        Should I name names?
Chris:        Hey, that's up to you. If it feels uncomfortable or awkward, we can bleep it out.
Caller:        Well, no.
Chris:        Just for identification purposes, you mean?
Caller:        I'm not ... Yeah, I'm not going to name someone's name. I'm going to name the name of the company.
Chris:        Sure. I don't care. Who cares?
Caller:        Because I think it adds a lot to the story. The company is called Bank Tech.
Chris:        Bank Tech.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So you're stuck in a job you hate and it's through a place called Bank Tech.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        I've never heard a more hate-able corporate name than Bank Tech.
Caller:        I know. Isn't it-
Chris:        It sounds-
Caller:        It's like they were trying to be a made up company.
Chris:        It sounds like a thing Mike Judge would make up.
Caller:        Yeah. It doesn't seem real.
Chris:        So you're just ... Wait, you're just wandering the halls, waiting for Bank Tech to fire you?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Okay, man. Okay, man. Okay, I got to ... Okay. Just wandering around, not talking to anybody, going on an exercise bike, sitting in your car, praying that Bank Tech forces you to leave because you don't have the means to do it so you need them to force you out, to kick you in the ass.
Caller:        Yeah because if they force me out, I either can cash out my 401(k) or get severance pay.
Chris:        Right, right. Goddamn, man. Bank Tech adds a whole new layer to it.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        Because I want to get to what's underneath this, if this is okay. Because I'm so glad asked what's behind it. Because your whole thing is, "I want to get out of this job." But here's the thing I wonder about.
Chris:        Because, again, I complain a lot in my work about getting bullied and stuff growing up. But I've had it relatively easy, and I know that you're a guy who I can say for you to just wind up being a guy with a head on your shoulders, that sounds to me like a victory.
Chris:        Sounds to me like there were a lot of factors lined up where you're not the type of person who's even supposed to graduate college, if I'm speaking frankly.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Person born to parents in prison. The deck is stacked against them. So you fought through. You're a fighter. You've been a fighter at points in your life. Because to get to that point, that's not easy.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Nobody would have blamed you if you were the kid burning other kids with cigarettes in high school. Nobody would have blamed you. They would've blamed your parents.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You weren't that kid. You went to college. You got a degree.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You're a fighter.
Caller:        My brother did tell me that recently. He said, "You've already won, so don't stress out that much. Just do it. Just do what you want."
Chris:        And how'd that sit with you?
Caller:        It felt good for someone that knows me to say that.
Chris:        Yeah, and it sounds totally true. But it sounds to me like you won Round 1, but you want to fight more rounds.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        What is it? What is it ... I don't know. I don't know. Do you feel like you're not supposed to take it further?
Caller:        No. I don't think so.
Chris:        Is it just you don't know how?
Caller:        Yeah. It could be part of it.
Chris:        Do you still know your mom?
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative). What?
Chris:        Do you have a relationship with your mom?
Caller:        No.
Chris:        Have you ever?
Caller:        No.
Chris:        Yeah. Do you want-
Caller:        She's been around, in and out of prison. But it was the kind of thing, like we had some awkward dinners at a Chinese buffet and stuff.
Chris:        So sad. You've had some sad interactions with your mom.
Caller:        Yeah. And it was the kind of thing where I put in some effort around the time I was in college and she seemed to be doing well. But I kind of realized, "Oh, even if I hold nothing against you, even if I'm not bitter, this isn't really going to be repaired. This isn't going to be much more than it is."
Chris:        Yeah. So you have to walk away from that one at some point. And it sounds like you're the one putting in all the effort, so ...
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        So, what is ... You take a step back. You're sitting in your car. You're daydreaming.
Caller:        Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Chris:        If money's no object, if background is nothing to overcome, what's the dream? What would it be with none of those factors? What would the dream job be?
Chris:        What would the dream life be? What's the dream life?
Caller:        Don't know if I can confidently give you an answer on that.
Chris:        Wow. That is a tough one.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        What makes you happy on a daily basis. What are the moments that wake you up?
Caller:        I don't know. What do you mean "the moments that wake me up"? The things that light my fire, get me going?
Chris:        Yeah, like the things that make you feel like you're not just smoking weed to numb yourself until you got to wake up the next morning and go back to Bank Tech and sit in a car? What are the moments where you feel like you're actually living and not just punching the clock at Bank Tech and fixing your car?
Chris:        What are the moments that you feel like, "Fuck yeah. I'm actually doing it"?
Caller:        I don't know. I feel like there are things that I get excited about. Music or TV or something. I love your show.
Chris:        Thanks, man.
Caller:        But I feel a lot of those things, I'm living vicariously through. I'm enjoying it, but I'm not out there living or I'm not out there doing.
Chris:        And are you still in a small town?
Caller:        No.
Chris:        You're in a city.
Caller:        Yeah. I moved.
Chris:        So is it a city that has ... Can I ask is it a city that has a culture like that? Does it have a culture of comedy? Does it have a culture of music? Do you go experience those things live, in person?
Caller:        Yeah. Not lately. Lately, it's been go to work, go home, Internet, drink, smoke, sleep, repeat.
Chris:        So we can call this one. Honestly, you're giving up a little bit, huh?
Caller:        No, I'm not giving up. Do you feel like I am, like shutting down?
Chris:        I don't know. I mean I don't know you at all beyond the past 43 minutes of our time together. But I'll say, sounds to me like what you're describing is someone who entered the world under circumstances that I think most people would say maybe shouldn't have to enter the world with those deficits.
Chris:        And it sounds to me like you fought. It sounds to me like you fought all the way through college. And then it sounds like after college, it sounds like you stopped fighting. But I don't really know. But that's just what it sounds like based on what you're telling me.
Chris:        It sounds like you've stopped fighting.
Caller:        Yeah. That's accurate, I think.
Chris:        It sounds to me like-
Caller:        I think I-
Chris:        A lot of the stuff you were talking about earlier of like, "I want to get out, get a new job, figure out what it is, take an improv class, see what my thing is, experience." It seems like to me, the main thing is you got to get fighting again, right?
Caller:        Yeah. I've just got to do it.
Chris:        But you don't know what "it" is.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        And you have no answers. Are you still in Texas?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You ever think about getting out of Texas?
Caller:        Yeah. I feel like I've never really entertained it as a real possibility. But it's something I've thought about the last year, so maybe I just need to make a bigger change to force myself to get moving. Move in some direction.
Chris:        And let me ask you this. I haven't asked you this. Currently, friend unit, love life, these other things outside of the professional that round you out. These other platforms. How are they doing?
Caller:        Friends. I've got friends. A lot of friends, I don't hang out with enough. A lot of things I'm saying like, "Oh, I'm not doing ... I've got all my friends that are doing improv are at a comedy club or somewhere I could just show up at. But I'm just not doing that.
Chris:        So this is depression.
Caller:        Yeah, I think so. And I think I've had plenty of friends and girlfriends say, "You're depressed. You've got problems," and I think I'm in denial.
Chris:        I've been there for ... I spent many years there. And I get it's hard to admit that and people judge it and it's hard to just kind of suck it up and go get help but it sounds to me like you're well aware that you got to.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        And it sounds to me like you've found some things that kind of numb you to, but nothing that's actually making some progress to get out of it.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Like drinking and weed will get you through the day, but-
Caller:        Yeah, it's not going to get me anywhere good.
Chris:        And you've brought up improv a couple times. I wonder why you're not just doing it. That's what I'm wondering, why you're not just doing it. You say meditating changes your day and then you just don't do it. You just don't do it.
Chris:        And I know it's not easy. And I know that's part of why it's a thing that needs medication and treatment, and I'm in ... I take those medications and treatment. But what do I got to do to get you off this phone? What do I gotta do that when you get off this phone, you actually pick up the phone and call one of those improv friends and ask them how to get involved?
Chris:        What do I gotta do here? What do I gotta do? You tell me what I got to do because I want to help and we got 13 minutes left. And then the phone gets hung up and I might never speak to you again in our whole lives. And this one, I'm going to think about forever.
Chris:        How do I get you out of a company called Bank Tech? What do I do to make a company called Bank Tech be a thing that's not factored in anyone's life? Because Bank Techs sounds-
Caller:        Right. I've got to ... That's the first dragon I've got to slay, right?
Chris:        You do. You gotta slay that dragon. That's the perfect way to phrase it.
Chris:        How do I get you to slay this dragon, my man? And no, but here's the thing. I would even say this. There's a way for you to live a life where you have to ... Because you have to go there right now, and that's miserable, and you don't like it. And that's fine.
Chris:        But what's the other shit you can be doing? What's the shit you can be doing at night to just get yourself feeling fulfilled a little bit, get yourself like there's something after it that's not just go home and wait for the next time at Bank Tech?
Chris:        What do I gotta do on this one? How do we do this? What do we do?
Caller:        I just got to get motivated, right?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Do you have a pep talk? How do I start fighting?
Chris:        I feel like this whole phone call has been the goddamn pep talk.
Caller:        Yeah. I don't know if you can do more.
Chris:        But I want to so bad.
Caller:        Right? Isn't it on me?
Chris:        It is on you, but it's a tough thing to say because it sounds like you've lived the life where it's always been on you. And I don't like that. I don't think that that's fucking fair.
Chris:        And I bet that gets exhausting. I bet it gets exhausting for you to always have to be the one to just keep pushing, keep pushing. I bet that's fucking exhausting and it has been from day one.
Caller:        Yeah. That might be part of what this ... I kind of achieved some goals, felt good, and just got lazy, let things go.
Chris:        Well, I always think it's not lazy ... To me, it's not laziness. It's that you set your goals when you're young, and then you realize those goals are actually achievable. And then you're left holding the bag going, "Well, wait. I thought that was going to take my whole life."
Caller:        Yeah. Kind of what's next?
Chris:        Yeah. It seems to me like ... You know, I think ... I don't know if this is everywhere in the world, but Americans, the sense I get is we definitely put ourselves in the center of this idea of there's a story that's going to have a beginning, middle, and end.
Chris:        And then you get to something that feels like an end, and you're like, "Oh, wait. I have to live 60 more years. Oh, shit."
Caller:        Yeah. But I think I just got to start taking the small steps, right? Doing the things. The list I told you.
Chris:        Dude, go to see a comedy show tonight. You should be going to see a band or a comedy show every night. You should be staying out late and talking to people every night. Because it sounds like you have a job where you could show up and literally go to sleep and no one would care.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        It sounds like if you got-
Caller:        No one would notice or it wouldn't matter.
Chris:        It sounds like if you got four hours of sleep every night because you were out experiencing art and hanging out with people and doing crazy things and just living, you could come into Bank Tech, say hello, lay down under your desk, wake up eight hours later, and do it all again, and there would be no consequences.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Go out every night.
Caller:        I haven't been ... I haven't been living.
Chris:        You got to live.
Caller:        I feel like I get off work and I'm like, "Oh, eight hours of sleep. Let's get through traffic and get home, get eight hours."
Chris:        You hate that. You gotta stop doing it. What is tonight? Tonight's Monday.
Chris:        Something, there's something cool going on. You're in a city. I'm just going to ask. My heart is bleeding a little bit. What city are you in? I know that this might identify you. What city are you in? Can I ask?
Caller:        No. Okay. I'm in Dallas.
Chris:        Dallas. There's shit to do in Dallas. The Dallas–Fort Worth area. One of the best meals of my life was eating at Joe Garcia's in Dallas. You know that place?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That's a great place.
Caller:        No.
Chris:        No, you don't?
Caller:        Yeah, I live in Denton and I work in Dallas.
Chris:        Denton has a huge music scene.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        Denton's like arts hub of Texas. You're in the middle of it all. Go. You go see The Marked Men. You go see the Mind Spiders. Even I know the bands that are in Denton, and I live in New York. You go. You live in Denton. It's full of college people who are beautiful and young and making mistakes.
Chris:        You're in Denton? You got to just go. There's stuff everywhere. It's one of the arts hubs. It's one of those places that you find out about that's like an oasis in a place that has a reputation for not being cultural. And then you got a place like Denton and it's not even Austin that's all blown out.
Chris:        It's Denton. It's still pure. You got to go. You got to just go outside. What are you ... You got this. I know the bands you could be seeing.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        The Marked Men are like Denton legends in the punk world and they did it all themselves. There's a huge DIY community. You got this. It's right there. You just got to walk in and be a part of it. You're a well-spoken guy, and clearly a nice guy. You can do it.
Caller:        Yeah, there's no excuses there.
Chris:        I'm going to wonder forever if you did it.
Caller:        I should've-
Chris:        I'm going to wonder forever if you did it. We got seven minutes and I'm not convinced.
Caller:        Oh, I don't know. I'm not convinced, either.
Chris:        No. That's not the answer I wanted. I wanted you the say, "No. This is a permanent change."
Caller:        I've seen enough of my patterns. You'll know.
Chris:        Oh, God.
Caller:        I'll go do it and you'll know.
Chris:        How will I know?
Caller:        Is that what you want to hear? I don't know.
Chris:        No. You're lying to me. I just want you to be happy and see music and comedy and then wrestle all the autistic kids your heart desires.
Caller:        Oh, it's just-
Chris:        Are you inside that ... Are you still in that weird hallway?
Caller:        No, I'm outside by a tree that I'm pacing around.
Chris:        You're by a tree? You're working and they don't care? You're not going to get in any trouble for this?
Caller:        No. My boss is gone for the week.
Chris:        I need you ... Just start screaming. I need you to scream as loud as you can.
Caller:        My boss is gone for the week and I'm in charge of the office.
Chris:        Start screaming. I need you to scream as loud as you can. Break the pattern. Do a thing. That's the first ... More. That's a first step. That's what I got. That's the first step. You just started screaming in the middle of the day.
Caller:        That's the first step?
Chris:        I think so, man. We got to bust this out.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You've come too far. You've come too far to know that your ... You've come too far to know that your wheels are spinning and to not keep going.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        There's no way. There's no way.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You sound like a genuinely nice guy. Is that true? Are you a nice guy?
Caller:        Yeah. Yeah, I'm nice. I think I try to-
Chris:        And you don't have to be.
Caller:        I try to make it my goal to at least be nice to people.
Chris:        And you don't have to be. The world wasn't nice to you in the beginning. So we're not just going to let this peter out. Did it feel good to scream or just weird?
Caller:        Yeah, no. It felt good. I'm a very loud person.
Chris:        That's good. Great. I'm going to try it. Ready?
Caller:        Yeah. Are you going to go? Do you feel better?
Chris:        Are those birds? Do I hear birds back there?
Caller:        Was that good? Yeah, there are birds around here. Someone pulled up right next to me or I'd scream. Should I scream anyways?
Chris:        You tell me if it would feel good, if it would feel good to-
Caller:        Yeah. Screaming feels good.
Chris:        Those birds are really loud, too.
Caller:        Yeah. It's kind of a little nature area out here.
Chris:        Oh, that sounds nice.
Caller:        Yeah. But, yeah. I mean, you've convinced me. I was aware of a lot of things. I don't have any excuses.
Chris:        Have you said these things out loud before. Have you expressed this discontent out loud before this?
Caller:        Yeah. Maybe not in this measured way, of really telling someone like, "Yeah, this is ... I know these are my issues." I'm constantly telling myself, "I know I'm drinking too much." And those kind of-
Chris:        Have you thought about ... Do you think you're at an alcoholic point? Can I ask bluntly?
Caller:        I think I would say no, but then if I wrote down on paper, "I go through a six-pack," or "I went through a bottle of whisky from Thursday to Sunday," it's not good.
Chris:        Now, can I ask another maybe uncomfortable question?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Are you drinking alone? Are you drinking alone?
Caller:        Oh, yeah. That's the only time.
Chris:        Dude, that's step one. At least drink with a buddy. At least drink with a buddy. At least drink in a bar. At least drink in a bar where the bartender's there.
Caller:        Oh, yeah. No, because then that wouldn't be a problem.
Chris:        That's step one. That's step one.
Caller:        But, yeah. Just shots of Jameson off the bookshelf.
Chris:        That's it. That's it right there.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You could be drinking at a music show or you could be drinking in the comedy club.
Caller:        Yeah, I-
Chris:        You could be killing two birds with one stone. You could be retaining the drinking that makes you feel good. Yeah. Yes, say it.
Caller:        I go to work and I'm 10 minutes away from Dallas Comedy House.
Chris:        You're killing me. You could be stopping there. You could be ... Do they have open mics there?
Caller:        Yeah. Open mics, I've known for months. Open mics Tuesday. I've got something ready.
Chris:        You've got an act. You've got an act you want to try?
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You're doing it tomorrow. You're doing it tomorrow. What time is the open mic?
Caller:        I think it's at 7:00 or 8:00.
Chris:        So, you could ... On the way home from work, you could stop. You could get a meal. You could have a courage shot, and you could go do it. And it wouldn't even really affect your commute. It would just be a meal to eat.
Caller:        Yeah. It'd be right where I'm working.
Chris:        You're doing it tomorrow. Promise me you're doing it tomorrow. Promise me.
Caller:        I'll do it tomorrow.
Chris:        Promise. You have to.
Caller:        I promise. I promise. And if I'm promising you, that holds some weight to it.
Chris:        I'm telling you, I took my ... When you said you work next to the Dallas Comedy House, I took my glasses off and I threw them on this table hard enough that I almost broke them.
Caller:        I'm sorry.
Chris:        No. No apologies.
Caller:        It's not that bad?
Chris:        No apologies.
Caller:        I just need to be doing it, right?
Chris:        No. Because you're right there. You're going to go do the open mic.
Caller:        And I could tell you exactly ... I could tell you the time and day of the open mic.
Chris:        You're ready to do it. And you're doing it tomorrow. And it's free. We're looking it up on the website right now. It's free. You're doing it tomorrow. You're going to do it.
Chris:        And here's what's going to happen is you're going to go, and it's going to go terrible. It's your first open mic. It's going to go awful. It's not going to be fun. You're not going to be funny, and it's going to feel really uncomfortable.
Chris:        But you're going to feel fucking alive, man. You're going to feel alive.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        And do me a favor. You're going to do me a favor. You're going to get the movie Ikiru by Akira Kurosawa. I know this is pretentious. Watch that movie. Watch that movie.
Caller:        Akiru? A-K-I-R-U?
Chris:        I-K-I-R-U.
Caller:        Okay.
Chris:        Promise me you'll watch. That movie changed my life and got me motivated. We got less than a minute left and then the phone's going to get hung up even though I want to talk to you all day. You promise me you do that open mic tomorrow? You promise me?
Caller:        Yeah. I'll get it done.
Chris:        Okay, let's seal the promise. Do you know how we have to seal the promise?
Caller:        How do we seal it?
Chris:        Both at the same time. Ready? One, two, three.
Chris:        I'm going to do an open mic tomorrow.
Caller:        I'll do it tomorrow.
Chris:        Scream it.
Caller:        I'm going to do an open mic tomorrow.
Chris:        You screamed that one less loud. I felt you. I felt you not committing. I felt you not committing to it.
Caller:        Yeah. I'm going to do an open mic tomorrow.
Chris:        15 seconds left, and I just felt like you're going to bail on it.
Caller:        I'm going to do my best.
Chris:        Don't bail.
Caller:        I'm going to do it for Chris Gethard.
Chris:        Do it for me, man.
Caller:        I'll-
Chris:        Four, three, two, one. Our phone's going to cut off. Do it. I love you.
Caller:        Alright. Love you, too.
Chris:        This is, of course, the infamous, iconic song from the swing scene in Ikiru, the 1952 Kurosawa movie I pretentiously mentioned at the end of that call. If you have seen that movie, your heart is now ripped out of your chest because it's heartbreaking.
