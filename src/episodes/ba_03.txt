Deaf
6/13/2017
Caller:        Hello?
Chris:        Hi.
Caller:        Oh, hi. How's it going?
Chris:        It's okay. How about you?
Caller:        I can't complain.
Chris:        That's good. It sounds like we're on the same page about that one.
Caller:        Yeah, for sure. But actually, Chris, there's something I have to explain to you right off the bat before we get too far in this conversation. So this voice that you're hearing right now is actually not who you're going to be speaking to today. The person that wants to speak to you happens to be deaf, and he wanted to have a conversation with you, so I'm just a friend to this person who agreed to make this conversation go as smoothly as possible.
Chris:        Wow. That's ... Okay, that's head spinning. Okay, this is cool. Let me ... So the logistics, I'm ... So I'll speak and you speak sign language, you'll pass on what I say and your friend will let you know how to respond? Is that how this works?
Caller:        Exactly. So while you're speaking, I'll relay it to him in sign. He's going to sign back to me and I will hand off the new information to you.
Chris:        Wow. Okay, this is exciting. Right away, I feel like we should all just say this is an experiment that I haven't done before and I bet you haven't, so the pacing of this one might be a little different than what our listeners are used to, but I think anybody listening would be excited to give it a chance, so that's cool
Caller:        Yeah, so just want to let you know, I set it up for him so from this point on, it's anything he signed, not from me.
Chris:        Great. Great. Thank you for doing this. This is really ... This is exciting.
Caller:        Oh, any time.
Chris:        Are you a regular ... As far as the podcast itself, I don't want to be insulting in any way, it is an audio medium. I'm a little surprised to have someone who's hearing impaired reach out just because of that. Maybe you could let me know how you came to know the show?
Caller:        Yeah, I figured that was what was going to catch your attention, so when I called in I explained that. I am actually a fan of this podcast and I know some other work you've done. For me, what I do to hear podcasts is I send it out to get translated into English. So I read all your podcasts. There are services that will do that for me.
Chris:        Wow. That ... I want to apologize for the amount of ums and likes and sos you've had to read, also the amount of times that I get excited, ask a question, then reiterate it like three or four times before I let the person answer. I feel like I infuriate myself with that. You maybe more than any other consumer of the show ... I just want to apologize, because you take it on the chin harder than anybody when it comes to that.
Caller:        Honestly, I haven't even noticed that, but now that you point it out, I'm going to read through again and probably judge you a little bit. But honestly, reading through, your podcast is one of best to read through because it's a phone conversation, so it's nice back and forth, nice back and forth. I tried other ones, like I enjoy comedy, and ... like Comedy Bang Bang is so hard to read, even though I really enjoy it at times, but I know I'm missing more than half the jokes out of the just the context is so different when it's spoken. But no actually, this podcast is my fun read during the week, just getting to hear all these different stories. It's really awesome. I'm sure it's great to listen to, but I have a great time reading it, as well.
Chris:        That's very cool. Thank you. Maybe let me know. As you know from reading the transcripts, I like to just get into it, so as always, anything that you don't want to answer, just tell me buzz off, that's fine. Were you born deaf? Is this something that happened in the course of your life? Maybe you can just let me know the background.
Caller:        Yeah, of course. Just so you know, deaf people are really blunt, so don't ever worry about asking the wrong questions. I would rather you just put it out there. We're blunt people. We're very forward. So I think you'll probably notice that within this conversation.
Caller:        Yeah, so actually I was born hard of hearing. I used to wear hearing aids and at that time, growing up, I would say I would've more had like a hearing perspective on life. But then around age six, I got sick and the rest of my hearing went. So I've been deaf ever since like six years old.
Chris:        Wow. That must be pretty brutal for a six-year-old kid to have to figure out that new world. I feel like that's just old enough that you can understand what's going on and not nearly old enough to be able to process that.
Caller:        I mean, to be honest, I already had some hearing loss, so I already could tell I was different. I just didn't understand why or how ... I just didn't have an identity of being deaf or hard of hearing. And then when it happened, I knew, I could tell in that time I was different, that there was a change, I just didn't understand what it was because I wasn't surrounded by that culture yet. So I don't know, it wasn't so much a shock of it happening, it was just more of the community around me didn't know what to do with me.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        So that was probably the harder part.
Chris:        So even though you were hard of hearing, your parents ... you weren't in a school or in classes dealing with that. This was something that when it became a full-fledged thing, it was now you have to kind of get in the deep end on that.
Caller:        Yeah, exactly. Beforehand, I was just in a public school and then when I lost my hearing, I continued in the public school for about two years and I just, I couldn't keep up and also I wasn't fluent in sign at the time, so it wasn't like even having an interpreter would've made a difference. So I basically had to drop out of school and then they put me into a deaf program where I started back to the beginnings and caught myself back up to what a six -year-old should know at that time, and then I stayed in a deaf school all the way up until in college level.
Chris:        Wow, and then when you go to college ... Because I was totally overwhelmed and scared and depressed by college, and I have all five of my senses. It's just such a radical life change. To go from at that point, what 10, 11, years of schooling that is designed to help with this issue, into college, that must've been the most overwhelming stretch in the world.
Caller:        Yeah, I found college overwhelming, but honestly, it wasn't the deaf part, it was just social anxiety and being new, just being like ... I'm a big dork, so I felt like it was kind of hard to fit in in that way. The deaf part ... If anything, I was like, "Ah, people are always interested to learn sign," and if anything, I used it to my advantage with the ladies, to be honest. But no, the signing part wasn't what scared me. It was just being away and being on my own. At that point, I was used to being ... I mean yes, I went to deaf schools, but I still had a world of all these hearing people around me that didn't know sign, that I had to deal with all the time, so it wasn't a new situation for me. But I know for some people in the deaf community, that absolutely would be.
Chris:        Now, we've got to pump the brakes a little bit. I've got to bring it back to something you said. In what way were you using your deafness as a tool with the ladies? Because that sounds like you really went big on some baller shit.
Caller:        All right, I guess I'll tell you my tools I used. Right away, you could tell I was deaf and everyone gets excited and be like, "Oh, how do you sign this? How do you sign that?" So I became cool in that matter. I also had party tricks I would do to break the ice. One of my favorite ones I would do, I call it the party trick, was I would have a friend or a girl maybe I was interested in to try to make her laugh, I'm always about making the laugh, I would get her to ... I'd be like, "Hey, watch this," and then I would find a circle of people that I didn't really know yet that were in conversation and I would just walk up and kind of like nod along, kind of join the conversation, make it seem like I knew what was ... and I would purposely try not to read their lips and that, because I just wanted to go in blind, and then I would just blurt out the most random thing I could think of in that time and just like ... I don't know what it was, but people found that hilarious and then I'd walk away and then I would go back to them and be like, "How funny was that?"
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        For some reason, it worked. Now hearing it out loud, I'm like, "Jesus Christ, it's really not that funny."
Chris:        No, that's pretty funny. Pretty funny. Do you get those moments when it is working, when you're vibing with a girl, you're alone, and then does she have to just ask, "How do I sign 'I'm ready to take this to the next level'?" And then you have to teach her? Did you ever have a moment where it's like Ghost with Patrick Swayze and the sculpting, where you're like, "You're doing it wrong," and you stand behind her and take her hands and mold them into the shape of the correct signage?
Caller:        Yeah, it's ... No. No. No, to be honest, no. Like I said, I'm pretty used to hearing culture, so I read lips pretty well. I do use vocal, so a lot of people will just ask more out of curiosity, but honestly, a lot of people will forget while I'm talking and look away, and that's when I have to be like, "Hey, just look at me when you talk, that's all."
Caller:        But other than that, no, it's more of like people would just be interested, ask questions about what it's like to be deaf. A question I used to get asked all the time, "Do you dream in sign?" So I don't know, sometimes they were great and funny, other times I'm like, "Ugh, this is just arrogant and ..." I don't know, I would stand up for myself more compared to back then, I'd just be like, "Whatever, it's a cute girl. Whatever she wants to say, it's fine."
Chris:        Yeah. I know you just brought it up as the example of an ignorant question, but I've never thought about it before. Do you dream in sign? I apologize to immediately ask, but I've never thought about that in my life.
Caller:        Yeah, I would say I do. Yeah, whenever I'm dreaming, if someone's communicating with me, I just picture it in sign because that's how I communicate. But again, I'm only talking about me. I can't talk for any other deaf person in the community about their dreams and what they're doing.
Chris:        Right.
Caller:        But yeah, I always say yeah, I basically dream in sign. I get asked, "Even if that person doesn't know sign?" and I'm like, "Yeah, I fill it in for them."
Chris:        Wow. Now, I've read ... I tend to read a ton because I'm a nerd that way, and I'm pretty certain that there's a school for the hearing impaired in my neighborhood because very often on the subways at certain times of day, there will just be a lot of kids signing to each other and it's clear that there's a school situation. I've read, and again, total ignorance, I'm not asking you to speak for everyone in your community, I have read that there's maybe a trend, and you might be able to fill me in more, that sometimes there is almost like a level of anger in the deaf community towards the hearing community that the hearing community doesn't necessarily realize exists. Do you know what I'm referring to?
Caller:        Yeah, that's definitely some point views. I mean, I knew this would go into topics of talking about deaf culture and deaf community, it's just hard because I can only talk from my perspective my personal experiences. But yeah, absolutely, I feel like it's just there's a lot of times ... I want to put it more, it's not so much about not being seen, but not realizing our needs and just ... Again, I'm looking at this more of adult point of view now, simple things like little things I need to get my job done during the day and having things written out or interpreters or just one-on-one time, sometimes it just gets cut and people will just forget and act like, "Well, you'll figure it out," and not realizing when you have that kind of attitude, I miss out on what you need me to know and it just feels bare and vulnerable and it does kind of feel like you're not being seen at times and that can ...
Caller:        Yeah, that definitely is rough, especially if you're a kid, and I totally know what school you're talking about, too, so yeah ... You live in New York City, right?
Chris:        Yeah, I live in Jackson Heights, Queens.
Caller:        Yeah, okay. There's a huge ... Yeah, there's a big deaf school I Queens I know of. It also depends on what kind of culture you grew up around. Sometimes there's communities that are hardcore strong deaf where there's a lot of deaf people in that area and they all support each other, like you could go to the grocery store or to the doctor or anywhere and everyone knows sign. So those people kind of live in their own little bubble of a deaf-friendly environment, and then you have other environments where you can't even get the help and support to learn sign but you're expected to just be oral and to read lips. So there's such a huge spectrum of what is available and not available in the deaf community. So there's definitely people that get frustrated easily with the lack of resources.
Chris:        I also have to wonder, too, on a social level ... I've never thought about this before, but I would imagine someone who learns to live their life through visual cues, sign language but also things like eye contact are important, body language, you must maybe ... I would imagine ... Is it fair to say, there must be some level at which you're perceiving those things at a different way, and a lot of people's instinct when they're around someone different is to demonstrate discomfort. Do you see other people's discomfort in a way ... I don't know, it's a sad question, but does it just come through clear and hurt a little bit more? Or is that just me thinking too hard about this?
Caller:        Hmm, that's a good one. I wouldn't say it's hurt. I'd rather people be curious and ask questions. I think it's where it's coming from. If you're coming from a place of like, "Oh, you're different than me. Let me get to know that," I'm more than happy to share my experience with you. If it's coming from more of this ... The most annoying thing, to me, is when I tell someone, "Oh hey, I'm deaf," and they say, "I'm sorry." Why? I'm not sorry. I love who I am. Fuck you, this is great.
Caller:        Yeah, we definitely have a different perspective, and I think that's why deaf community has actually grown in the last couple years with popularity in media and ... There's been Broadway shows using sign more, and I think on like ... There's TV shows that show more deaf people and stuff. So I feel like we're becoming more visible and that's helping, but I still, I always get that feeling with a certain amount of people that will always feel apologetic, and that's the thing that feels so weird, is why they feel apologetic.
Caller:        I also just realized I cursed and I tried really hard to tell myself not to, because I am a mama's boy and I know you said your mom listens to this, so sorry, Sally.
Chris:        That's amazing. That's amazing you just ... So you just used sign language to say the phrase, "Sorry, Sally." Did you have to spell out the S-A-L-L-Y? That is ... I think my mom will be very touched by that.
Caller:        Yeah, I did have to spell out her name, but actually, the voice that you're hearing right now, we connected beforehand and we came up with some ... to help with the speed, we came up with some signs. We came up with a sign for podcast, for Chris, for Sally, so we can know quicker who we're referencing.
Chris:        Right. Right.
Caller:        So for Sally, we just did the sign for mom, but the letter S, so she knew I was talking about your mom.
Chris:        S mom. Sally is the S mom. Let's everybody spread the-
Caller:        S mom.
Chris:        Everybody spread the word. Now, there is something, since you did ... because there is this layer of someone sort of translating between two mediums for us, it does make me laugh, there is a world in which you are a person who has a female human speaking on your behalf, you could conceivably make her say anything you want out loud, a pretty popular podcast, you could ... She is honor bound to say anything you sign, so there is ... I don't know, you kind of are a puppet master right now.
Caller:        Oh, don't worry. I totally thought of that ahead of time and I wondered like, "What can I make her say right now?" But I'll wait on that. I'm not going to push it too far.
Chris:        Hey, we've got 40 minutes left, so don't forget to tell me to loop back around to that one. I also have to say, the nervous giggle at the end of that, it's hard for me to discern whether that was you giggling with the anticipation of doing that or your translator giggling as she said out loud the plan you and I are formulating between us to abuse this level of trust and kindness.
Caller:        Oh, that was all her just being nervous. But luckily, we're really good friends and I even ... The best is when we decided to do this ... Something you should know about this girl is she's very sweet, good girl, good person, and when I decided maybe I'll give it a try and call voicemail, I met up with her and she happened to be really drunk and I never seen her ever in that level. That's not her norm, she's not a drinker, so I was like, "Oh my God," and so I asked her, I was like, "Hey, let's call in," and she was overly confident, like "Hell yeah." We called, we left the voicemail, and then I think it was a day or two days later, I asked her, I was like, "So, did they ever reach out?" And she was like, "Who the hell are you talking about? Who's who?" She had no ... She totally forgot, and then when I reminded her, she was so embarrassed.
Chris:        So there are three people effectively participating in this discourse right now, and one of them was blackout drunk when it all came to be.
Caller:        Yeah, basically.
Chris:        And now you also have the ability to force her to tell that story from your perspective. It's a very fun thing to have at your disposal. I'm glad to be involved in this, it's making me giggle with a lot of glee. I never anticipated this being a part of my day today.
Caller:        I'm glad it makes you happy, because it's definitely making me happy over here. And something I wanted to point out, too, it's funny that you brought up the whole, you know you're hearing this female voice and I am male, and you can probably tell from her I'm sure sweet little gentle voice that she is this white girl and I'm also a black Puerto Rican man, so sometimes-
Chris:        Yes!
Caller:        ... it's hilarious when get an interpreter you know there's no way they can actually sound like who you are.
Chris:        Yes!
Caller:        So sometimes it's hilarious when you get an interpreter you know there's no way that can actually sound like who you are. Yeah, this girl's amazing, I'm not going to try to talk her down or ... I knew she'd do a great job. Oh my God, if you could see how red her face is right now. This is probably the weirdest job she's ever had to do.
Chris:        So just because you can't hear my laughter, I want to make sure that your translator describes it to you as ... How would I describe the laughter I just put out? As an enthusiastic, borderline scream-level laugh that reveled in the social discomfort that the young lady who is the middle person of this conversation has been forced to do.
Caller:        Well, I have to say she's very professional, so when you are laughing, she does match the level of laughter you're creating.
Chris:        Yes!
Caller:        That has to do with expression and that.
Chris:        That is great.
Caller:        So apparently, you just had a pretty big laugh there.
Chris:        Just because we did open this door, I do wonder. You said you are part black, part Puerto Rican male. Maybe you can let us know your height, your weight, just so we have a full image of who I'm actually speaking to, as juxtaposed to the very pixie-ish voice of a white girl that I am hearing?
Caller:        Yeah, sure. Okay, height, I'm about 6'2. I weigh like 185 ... I'm like long, skinny rail. I guess some people would say I have a hipster look, wear glasses. I'm a big dork. I'm very nerdy, and I think that comes clear easily from just me walking gangly into a room. So I don't know, I'm not sure how else to describe myself.
Chris:        Sorry to put you on the spot there but it's just the juxtaposition between the voice and the image is giving me great delight, so thank you for that. So we're having fun, I want to make sure we have a lot of fun in this conversation because that's what I'm down for. You mentioned that you're into comedy. I want to talk more about that, but before we do, just informationally and just out of fascination and hearing a little bit about your background, some of the awkward ways people behave, are there simple things ... Most people don't want to put in effort. I know that I can get very lazy. I have a two-pronged question. Average, everyday people, are there simple things we can be doing that will just make it a little easier for you and other deaf people we encounter? Are there little simple things where it's like, "Hey, this takes no effort, and just do it?"
Chris:        And then also, for myself as an entertainer, I wonder, are there simple things I can be doing ... Sometimes I'll be doing a show, my instinct isn't book a translator and have them on hand for everything I ever do. Are there simple, effortless things where it's like, "If you just did this, I can't tell you how much it would mean to deaf people when you encounter them"?
Caller:        Okay, I think ... Okay, I'm going to start entertainment-wise, because I am, I'm a big fan of entertainment. Honestly, little thing more people could do is just add captions to everything. I understand live is different, but if you're making videos, if you're a YouTube star and that, just add captions. That takes like no time at all, it's free to do, and you'll just all of the sudden open up the possibility of who will be watching you or connected to you. That's a big one. I actually tried to come see your Broadway show, I tried to hire someone, but they couldn't do it, so I never got to see it. But I'm sure it was awesome, even though it was the saddest title I've ever seen for a show.
Caller:        For the average person, I think patience is the main thing. I live in a city where everything's go, go ... I live in a big city, so everything's go, go, go, and sometimes people get frustrated over ... I understand, I'm always adapting myself to work with the hearing world and I've accepted that and that's fine. I understand the world we live in is hearing. But people get frustrated at me for needing to take 10 extra seconds to write down my needs or write down my order, and to me, I'm like, "Just be patient. It's fine. Just smile," sometimes people will get frustrated or something where I'm like, "Why are you frustrated?"
Caller:        And then makes it uncomfortable for no needed reason, because I'm ... I understand, I'm not what you were expecting to deal with that day, and if you just smile and try to communicate to me like a human rather than just speak to me, I have more than the highest respect for you out of just being a human being on this Earth. But some people will turn it into a big ... either an insulting level of patronizing or frustration out of like, "I don't want to deal with this. I'm not going to give you two seconds of my time." So I don't know, just be patient, people. Everyone's got their shit going on. Sorry Sally.
Chris:        Yeah, I imagine that would have to be ... When people are impatient, there has to be very warranted moments of anger where you're like, "Hey, just so you know, this is ... Believe me, for as hard as this simple transaction is on you, you're not the focus. It's not about you." There has to be a lot of feelings of that along the way, I would imagine.
Caller:        Yeah, exactly. It's like, it's not about you, and trust me, I have to deal with this shit over and over and over again every day, so if you can just for one moment realize, "Hey, they're going to go a different route than I'm used to," and just accept it as it is, and you actually might have some fun and learn something new out of it, too, so why get panicky and angry and frustrated just because I might write down something for you, hand it to you, and give you a thumbs up versus vocalizing it? I will never be able to understand people that get frustrated on that.
Chris:        Yeah. Yeah, and also when you just said you wanted to come see my show, that really broke my heart, because again, just the simple ignorance and getting caught up in my own pace, I did that show, what? All told, 150 times in different iterations, probably 80 or 90 times off Broadway, and I never thought once, hey, I would bet there are people more thoughtful than I who say, "I'm going to have a number of performances and along the way, I'm going to have a translator at some of them, we're going to advertise that, and I bet that means a lot to people," and I just ... As you said it, I was like, "Aw, that's a thing I could've done once that I bet would've meant a lot to some people." I didn't even do that once. That sucks.
Caller:        Well, there's a lot of [inaudible 00:38:59], I wouldn't say you're the one that sucks, but no, I mean honestly, entertainment interpreters is a new world in general. So even ... There are a lot of interpreters out there that just don't have the skills to do entertainment-level interpreting. I would say that's only become a popular request within the last four, five years. So there's still a need for those, and yeah, no sweat. Whatever. I tried, didn't work out. You didn't get my money. Oh well.
Chris:        You watched it on HBO, though, I'm ... HBO probably real good with the captions, I would imagine. That's a ... In my experience with them, top shelf organization.
Caller:        Yeah, HBO's pretty great with captions, and Oh my God, I didn't even know it's on there, so I'll have to catch up.
Chris:        Yeah, Career Suicide, now you'll know more about it beyond just the depressing title. You'll get a full 90 minutes of ultra-depressing content.
Caller:        Great. When I need a good cry, that kind of night where I just go, "You know what, I'm just going to buy some wine, a bottle of wine for myself, sit down on the couch, let Chris depress me," good to know that's a choice now.
Chris:        Oh, that's my bread and butter. That's been my whole career for about 15 years is depressing people and calling it comedy.
Caller:        Oh, don't worry, I noticed. I think that's part of why I like your stuff.
Chris:        Thanks. Here's a thing I'm sensing, and I might be reading between the lines, let me know if this is the case. You've described yourself as like a big dork a bunch of times, you say you've got glasses, you love entertainment, you love comedy. Have you ... Because also just in our interactions through this interpreter, you've made me laugh a whole bunch of times. Have you thought ... I don't know if I'm just reading into it too much. Is there any part of you that's wanted to entertain or do comedy? I'm just getting that sense that we might ... demographically, outside of this one major difference, we seem like similar people and I just have a hunch. Am I right or am I wrong?
Caller:        I've never wanted to be an actor or anything, but what I do in my life is like ... I mean, I do ASL performing. So yeah, I guess I am. I'm more like ... Yeah, I ... I don't want to give away too much, because the few people I know listening to this will for sure know it's me. I teach sign language in a performing arts way a lot. I have ... Ah, screw it. They're already going to know who I am. I have a piece where I perform ... Nope, you know what? Nope, not going to say it. People are going to ... No, never mind. But yeah, I am in the entertainment world in a little sense, and I'm very ... popular's not the right word. Well known. I'm well known in the deaf community for my work.
Chris:        I knew it! How did I know it?
Caller:        So I'm just going to put that there.
Chris:        We can just smell our own. I can smell another performer a mile away. I just knew it. That's cool. That's cool.
Caller:        Thanks. Yeah, thanks. It's not a world I thought I would get involved in at all, but ... My signing style is considered really ... stylized? I don't even know the right word to say for it, but signing style I use is very storytelling at all times, and people have ... I didn't even notice, people had to tell me, and so over time, I started to make a career based off of it and based of that career, I actually am my own boss now. I have a company where I get to use that all the time, and do whatever I want-
Chris:        This is my favorite shit. This is my favorite shit I've heard in a long time. Sorry, Sally. I think that's so cool. I think that's so cool. I often think about performing, and so much of it is about the ego. Right? So much of it is about scrambling, but then what it's really about deep down is finding ways to connect with other human beings and not feel so alone, and to hear that ... because I would have to imagine that when you're young and you're hearing disappears, the performing arts is one of the avenues that immediately feels cut off and that everybody stops talking about, and to hear that it does exist and you found your way into it, I am so impressed and so excited to hear that. It's rad.
Caller:        Yeah, thanks. That's really nice of you to say. Yeah, it's not like I did theater growing up all my life or anything. When I was younger, I was more into comic books and Star Trek, so I was more busy in that world, but as I got older, how I found my way to socialize and fit in, to make friends, yeah, I kind of just turned into entertainment, I guess? It's just funny, because I don't ... like I'm talking to you and I see you as a performer, an entertainer and that, and I think of myself and I'm like, "Uh, no. I don't do that." I don't know if that makes sense.
Chris:        Well, I don't know if that's just because of a cultural difference that I can never totally understand or if it's a self-confidence thing, but I will say I sniffed you out as a fellow performer a mile away, so if there's some part of you that's like, "I'm bashful about calling myself that," I would say cut that shit out, because it sounds like you're bringing it and I knew it. Here's the thing I wonder, I've got a million-dollar idea and I think you and I should team up on this one, and probably somebody's already done this. Has there ever been a performance ... because I would imagine, when you're performing in this world, is it largely performing for deaf audiences?
Caller:        It's a mix. Yeah, a lot of it's deaf, a lot of it's interpreters, CODA. There's a lot of different people that show interest in this world. Sometimes it's students learning sign for the first time. But at all performances, I always include an interpreter so it's open to hearing and deaf world. So it's always translated.
Chris:        Have you ever done performances, or has anyone ever done performances where it is a deaf audience and then one to two fully hearing people invited to ... I would actually pay a lot of money to attend a performance in sign language for an audience where I was the only person who didn't know sign language, to understand the experience of what I would imagine 90% of your entertainment experiences are. If that hasn't happened, I want to make that happen with you.
Caller:        Oh Chris, done and done. Game is on. I'll make this happen.
Chris:        Has anybody done that before?
Caller:        You want ... I understood, right? You want to be the only hearing person there, and you just want a bunch of deaf people signing around you and you've got to figure out what's going ... like a murder mystery style or something? You've got to figure out what the fuck happened?
Chris:        I want there to be a translator, just like you have, because I would have to imagine there are probably situations where you go to an environment where you see everyone around you laughing and you're just looking at this translator and the pacing and the tone is just different, and you've got to learn to navigate that, that the entertainment experience is just at a different pace. I would love it if there was one interpreter speaking your words, translating them from sign, everyone else understood sign and was working at the pace that you as a performer set out to accomplish and I had to scramble to formulate it on my own terms afterwards, because I think that that would be a great experience for people to be able to understand in some small way. Never fully understand, but in some small way.
Caller:        Huh, all right. Interesting. I mean, if you want to take on that challenge, sure. I'm down.
Chris:        Yeah. I also tend to talk shit like this and then never follow through, but that one would be exciting to me.
Caller:        That's okay. As much as I thought it was a great idea, I was like, "I'm not organizing this," so ... If someone else out there is listening and wants to deal with setting up between deaf workers and hearing workers and making this work, go for it and I'll show up.
Chris:        That's cool. Now, I want to get into some just fun, basic questions. I'm sure these are things you've heard a million times, but now that we're comfortable with each other, first thing. Have you ever witnessed something via lipreading from far away or across the room where you're like, "Oh, I'm the only person aware of this drama unfolding"? Have you ever seen people whispering and breaking up in public and you're like, "Oh, everyone around here is just moving on with their day, and I can tell this is a brutal breakup." Anything like that, that you get to see?
Caller:        No, I'm actually a pretty bad lipreader, even though I do use it. That's something with lipreading, that's another pet peeve that a lot of deaf people have, is expecting to lipread. I mean, we do it out of survival, but I almost look at lipreading the way that you talk about how much you hate math. It's either you've got it or you don't, and I'm just one of those people, it's just I don't naturally have it. So no, I wouldn't be skilled enough to do that.
Caller:        But to be fair, there have been times I've been out with friends and I will notice a situation going on and point it out because I'll be able to notice body language of like, "Oh shit, right there, right there," because that's my world. I read body language. It's like a little thing where I'm like, "Uh-oh, it's going down. I don't know what it is, but it can't be good."
Chris:        Similarly, because I don't know if this is just an ignorance that ... basically, before I even ask more questions like this in my excited, giddy little shitty tone, sorry Sally, is there often ... is one of the major things that ignorant people ask you about basically comparing deaf people to spies in some way who have access to information we don't? Does that get real old? Because I'm happy to just move on.
Caller:        Yeah, it happens a lot. A lot of people will be like, "What are they saying? What are they saying?" And the funny thing is, I don't think ... Again, just from my personal experience, deaf people don't eavesdrop. That is such a fucking hearing person thing, and I think it's weird that you guys eavesdrop on each other all the time, and the fact that you guys hear each other pee and poop is weird, too. I think that's so weird. In public bathrooms, people always talk about, "Well, I couldn't go because someone was in there to hear me," and I'm like, "People listen in on that? Why? That's disgusting."
Chris:        Well, it's not like you have a choice, but it ... I guess it ... That is a nice ... I guess you always look for the silver linings. You've never been in a public restroom and had to deal with someone just having a horrific diarrhea blowout next to you. You don't have to hear that. That's a nice silver lining.
Caller:        Yeah, you're right. I guess you don't have a choice. But yes, that exactly is part of my ... That's what you would put under deaf gains or deaf benefits. That's definitely a deaf benefit, is you don't ever have to listen to someone's body fluids moving through them.
Chris:        That's nice. Have you ever been in situation where shared sign language with people has ... I'm thinking of specifically like have you ever been in a situation that felt dangerous, where you were able to surreptitiously say to another person, "Hey, we've got to get out of here. This is ... Something bad's happening," and you escape the situation because of a shared sign language that maybe other people don't perceive that you're communicating around them?
Caller:        I don't know a dangerous situation. I'm pretty ... I don't put myself in situations that are very dangerous very often, but I definitely used it to get out of things with someone, absolutely. All the time. Again, my experience, but a lot of deaf people are shit talkers. We're visual people, so we look around and we see what's going on and yeah, a lot of us will just use sign to like, "What the hell is that over there?" So if you see people signing on, I don't know, the subway, bus, somewhere public, I would say there's like an 80% chance they're talking shit about someone around you and if you take a good look, you probably can figure out what and if not, it's probably you. Sorry. I'm sorry to say it. Like I said, we're blunt. We're blunt ass people. Sorry Sally.
Chris:        I love that. So on the times that I'm on the train, which around the time that this deaf school has gotten out and there's 10, 15 deaf kids on a train car with me, you're saying there's a high percentage chance they're looking at me and going, "That dude's forehead is comically large," and they're just signing that and I'm sitting in the middle of it and I have no idea?
Caller:        I mean yeah, especially if ... I think that school's like high school or something like that? They're mean. That age scares me. So if they're like high school age? Hell yeah, they're trying to impress each other, so I guess yeah, maybe you're an easy target. Sorry.
Chris:        I always have been. Always will be. I just try to have a thick skin and roll with it. That's cool. Do you ... Here's a-
Caller:        Exactly.
Chris:        Here's just a basic question, and again, you can only speak for yourself. Is it ... As far as different kinds of relationships in your life go, is it easier to want to have those relationships with other people who share what you're dealing with? And I'm thinking of different things, like romantically, I would imagine things like a doctor or a dentist. There's got to be both personal and sort of like in the infrastructure of your life, do you tend to seek out other people who share your experience? Is it easier that way?
Caller:        Yeah, we're definitely ... I mean, we're all drawn to people that are similar to us, so in some ways, yes, but I also feel like there's a lot of deaf cultural things that I don't connect to, like I'm interested in podcasts. That's something I talk about with my hearing friends all the time. They're the ones that introduced me to what podcasts are. So I actually have ... I did date a girl for a while who was hearing. She was fluent in sign. The main ... The first ... or main, shit. There's a couple of reasons why we broke up, and one of the first red alarms was we were out together and by this point, we'd been together around five months, and we were just discussing, signing whatever it was we were talking about, and all of the sudden, she just stopped and got really uncomfortable and I couldn't tell what's up and we were just sitting on a bus together and she was like, "Can we just not? I just don't want to right now."
Caller:        So we just sat in silence the rest of the way to where we were going, and once we were alone, I was like, "Can I talk to you now? What's going on?" And she admitted to me she's embarrassed to sign out in public, that she doesn't like being seen with this disabled guy, and that just like boom, really hit me hard. Wow, I was like falling for this girl and that's how you view me? It's ... I don't know. So in a sense, yeah, [inaudible 00:57:05] people that are more similar to avoid situations like that, but I don't know, I have a mix of people in my life. A lot of my family's not ... No one in my family is deaf except myself and my brother. Everyone else is hearing, and they're not fluent in sign.
Chris:        Wow. You and your brother, and no one else in your family. Can I ask, was it a genetic condition or a circumstance growing up for you and your brother?
Caller:        Yeah, it's definitely a gene. When he was born, he was full hearing and then he actually lost his hearing, all his hearing when he was 12. He got very sick and his hearing went out, and that's when we found out it's a gene that we have. I thought it was easier for me, because I already had hearing loss and I lost it even younger. He was a preteen and lost it, so it was a lot rougher for him, for sure.
Chris:        That's brutal.
Caller:        But yeah, it's just a gene that we carry with us, and a lot of people have it, apparently. I don't know, I'm not a doctor, but I'm told it's more common than you realize, but it either will affect you or won't.
Chris:        Yeah. That girl you dated, that really makes my blood boil for a number of reasons. First of all, it's just mean behavior. Second of all, why would someone put in all the time to learn sign language to a point of fluency only to feel shame about interacting with people who use it? That seems like ... You must've felt tricked, almost.
Caller:        Yeah. Oh, that's a whole story. That girl screwed me up for a long time. Yeah, she works with the deaf community, that's why she was fluent. She uses it for a job, and we met at deaf charity and it was one of those, I saw her across the room and I was just like, "Wow. Got to go talk to her," and we hit it off right away, gave her my number, we had a date a few days later and it was all awesome and great, but there was ... That's only the tip of the iceberg of ... She also brought up that she could never bring me home because I am black and she wouldn't want any of her parents or family to know. There was a lot of levels of how that girl just really-
Chris:        Oh, Jesus. I'm sure that other people in your life-
Caller:        ... she screwed up my confidence.
Chris:        I'm sure other people in your life have said this, but I think you're better off. I'm sure I'm not the first person to note that maybe someone who is discriminatory towards your hearing ability and also racist, those are two big strikes. I don't know if we want to wait around to see what the third strike even is.
Caller:        Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It was one of those stupid ... When I look back, I'm like, "I don't know why I put up even with that first moment." I should've just walked then. But I don't know, when you ... I fell hard for her. I definitely ... It's not like I told her, "I love you," or something right away, but you know when you're seeing someone and you just have that gut feeling this is for the long road? I was feeling that for her, and so it just, it was a big bombshell.
Caller:        But she also, once we were done, it just screwed me up in the sense that I felt like I really never knew how people actually felt about me. I became really self-conscious about how I present myself and how I look, and I noticed it affect my deaf identity. I used to always be proud, and then I started pulling back in this ... I don't want to use the word shameful, but in this, I just felt uncomfortable, just because of all of what this one girl did to me. But I'm really lucky in that, just so you know, yeah, she's way out of my life. I've grown from that situation and I'm now happily with a fiancee and we're doing great and she's not racist or against deaf people, so.
Chris:        Nice. That's great.
Caller:        Yeah, a big step up.
Chris:        Is your fiancee hearing impaired, as well?
Caller:        Yeah, she's deaf. By the way, I'm not saying you're arrogant, I'm just sharing, because I like to inform, but saying hearing impaired is actually more insulting because it's saying there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with saying deaf. That's like ... We would rather that.
Chris:        Oh wow. I'll tell you, I was sitting here patting myself on the back the whole time feeling like I was being very sensitive, and here I am putting my foot in my mouth get again with this goddamn podcast. This goddamn ... All right, I'm ... Okay, and I've said it about 85 times and you've just sucked it up each time, and then with seven and a half minutes left you're like, "Yo, fuck off on that."
Caller:        No, I kept debating, and that's the thing, I didn't want to say anything at first because I was like, "Nah, he's a good guy. He's not saying it," but ... and I also was like, "That's not the focus right now. I want to talk about something else," but then I was like, "This is a good ... I'll just put it out there." So just to the world, say deaf, say hard of hearing. Those aren't offensive. The people that are that know. But when you say hearing impaired, you make it sound like there's something wrong with them, and there's nothing wrong with being deaf or hard of hearing.
Chris:        Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about that. I had no intention of offending. I'm glad I know now that I ... I'll put that phrase in the trash pile.
Caller:        Yeah, no need to apologize, I'm just-
Chris:        Of course there is.
Caller:        ... I'm just informing. No, trust me. I mean, it's still used in government forms and shit. It's not really you, it's society. I guess this goes with ignoring the deaf needs in the sense that society still has that in textbooks and research and ... There's lot of government ... In the Disabilities Act, they still use hearing impaired even though the deaf community has been very loud saying, "Don't do that."
Chris:        All right. Well, consider it done on my end, and I bet a lot of other listeners. I bet there's a lot of ... There a lot of people listening to this right now who I think are probably ... because again, I would think that the large majority of people consuming this podcast are listeners, are people hearing it. I bet there are a lot of people who just started giggling, going, "Oh, Gethard, you just put your foot in a pile of shit." I bet there's a bunch of that right now, a lot of people going, "I'm glad I'm not that guy." So that's it, deaf. Hearing impaired, done. Out of there.
Chris:        Hey, I have a question. One of the things that I love about podcasts is I think there's a lot of podcasts focused on different communities. Are there any equivalent ... Are there podcasts for the deaf community? Are there audio podcasts, video podcasts? Is there an equivalent medium?
Caller:        I would say the equivalent is, there's a lot of YouTubers and there's different styles. There's comedians, there's informative types and that, so yeah, I feel like most of my podcast is more watching, I watch a lot of videos in sign. There's news in sign and stuff, so ... But I can't say 100% sure, but I am like 99.9% sure I'm probably your only deaf listener on your podcast. I'm sure you have other deaf fans. I remember watching your show and stuff, and that was awesome. That was great visual.
Chris:        Yeah, if there's one thing about the Chris Gethard Show, it's not always the smartest show, it doesn't always make the most sense, visually, it's always pretty impressive, I'd like to think.
Caller:        I agree with that. Yeah, definitely.
Chris:        A lot of that is because when we were on public access, the show was so bad and nobody really watches public access anymore, so my director was like, "We need to make this thing look as insane as possible so people might actually stop and wonder what's going on here."
Caller:        Oh, I can see that. Hey, at least you made it that far. That's still impressive, even if it's a shit show going on.
Chris:        Oh, a total shit show, most of the-
Caller:        It's something. I don't know. I liked it.
Chris:        Hey, I have a question. You mentioned that you have the episodes of this show transcribed and then you read them back. Is that a service you're paying for?
Caller:        No, no. I got access in that ... Luckily, no one around me at work knows sign at this level, so I can say it. I actually use my work all the time to get them done for me, and honestly, the cool ... Just so you know, there's a lot of people that work as translators who ask me to send them their next assignment because they want to do it, because I send them a lot of ... I do a lot of podcasts, including this one. I'll also send in This American Life, Serial, Missing & Murdered, which I know is making me sound like a psycho, but I just find that stuff fascinating.
Chris:        Same here.
Caller:        But yeah, I use handful of people who ... I rotate through them, because they say they ... I didn't even think about it, they get to sit and listen to these podcasts and just type them out, and what a fun way ... because usually what they're typing out is more like college level lectures or a work meeting being written out for some of the staff and that, so I send them way more fun material to work with, so yay.
Chris:        I would have to imagine ... Is there ... I want to look into it. I would have to imagine that there's probably ... I could probably step up and do that. I could probably be paying a transcription service on my end to get these episodes out there. I would like to do that. That seems easy enough, right?
Caller:        If you're interested in doing it, sure. Yeah, that would be awesome. It would just take away a chore I do once a week.
Chris:        I think my point would be that maybe then it could be something that extends beyond just you, a dedicated podcast consumer, listener. I'll say listener, regardless of the fact that you're reading it. I think that that's fair. I would like to think that maybe it can go beyond just a personal favor to you and maybe that other people in a community that doesn't have access to this might now have access to it and feel included.
Caller:        Yeah, I absolutely agree with that, so go for it and if you are able to get it in written form, I promise you I will spread the word through the community for you.
Chris:        That would be a very Chris Gethard moment, wouldn't it, if it was like, who's the biggest demographic that likes your podcast? Oh, actually, my podcast is huge in the deaf community. That's a very Gethard thing to be able to say. I would love that. I would love to become the number one podcast in the deaf community. I feel like that really fits in with my overall body of work.
Caller:        Hell yeah, that'd be awesome. It's a larger population than you probably realize, and why not? Screw it, it pays the bills and you've got fans. That'd be awesome.
Chris:        I am into it. This is ... We have about a minute left, I think, if we ... I want to thank you. It's been so fun, and you know what? My favorite thing about this podcast is I have talked to so many people from so many walks of life, and I know I quote Morrissey too much on this podcast. He has this quote I love, which is, "There is no such thing as normal," and that's been the most eye-opening thing about me doing this podcast. Every single person I talk to, totally different corners of the world, different life experiences, everybody's just trying to get through the day, trying to get over the heartbreaks, trying to throw down, do their thing. It's really-
Caller:        Yes, we're all the same, really, at the end of the day. We want basically the same things. We just go different ways of getting there. By the way, is there anything you want my interpreter to say? To make her say?
Chris:        Ooh, yeah, no, that's on you. That's ... Let's spend the last 30 seconds knowing it was so nice talking to you, thank you for filling me in, thank you for correcting my ignorant language, thank you for telling me what your life is like, really a beautiful conversation. Now for the last 30 seconds, let's everyone listening understand you are no longer speaking for yourself, but in fact, forcing a translator to say whatever pops into your head as punishment for being blackout drunk when agreeing to do this.
Caller:        Okay. Oh, man. Now I don't even know what to make her say! Oh, I'm frustrated. Fart, bananas, potatoes. Losing control. Shit, shit, shit. Diarrhea.
Chris:        Fart, bananas, potatoes. Shit, shit, shit, diarrhea. Harry, write it down, we've got to make a T-shirt.
Caller:        It's gotta say it all.
Chris:        Fart, bananas, potatoes needs to be a T-shirt. Fart, bananas, potatoes.
