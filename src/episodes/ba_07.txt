Chris:        Halo Top is changing the way people eat ice cream one scoop at a time. I got a freezer full of this stuff, not because they hooked it up because they're an advertiser, because my wife loves it and she got me addicted to it, I love it. At only 280 to 360 calories per pint, Halo Top has less calories than traditional ice cream, but still tastes incredible. It's delicious and creamy, just like ice cream should be with over 20 flavors to choose from. Halo Top has a flavor for every mood, from regular flavors like chocolate and vanilla bean to other mouth watering flavors like cinnamon roll. Get out of here, that's... I'm going to get that today. Candy Bar is another flavor, Pancakes and Waffles, this is good stuff.
Chris:        I have it in my freezer. I was eating it the other day. It is delicious. Halo Top's available nationwide. Find your pint at Halotop.com or on social media, @halotopcreamery. Halotop.com, say goodbye to guilt, say hello to Halo Top.
Chris:        Hello to everybody who forgot to record this part in the studio, so you have to do it on your phone in a bar. It's Beautiful Anonymous. One hour, one phone call. No names, no holds barred.
Chris:        Is it Tuesday already? It must be Tuesday. Here we are. It's another episode of Beautiful Anonymous, a show where people call some guy on the phone and the guy reacts and sometimes tries to be funny, when appropriate, while anyone in the world has a chance to get up on a soapbox, a platform and just tell us who they are, what they're thinking about, what they're dealing with, what their past has been like and man, am I lucky to do this.
Chris:        I tell you, I was doing shows in Syracuse, New York this past weekend. It was at a mall, it was at a giant mall. One of the biggest malls in the United States. The comedy club was across from a Margaritaville and next to a Dave & Busters, this is true. Not my usual. Usually, they send me to the hip punk rock part of town. I'll do a music venue or something like that. I said, "No, I want to do the clubs, man. I want to get out there and grind out a bunch of shows over a bunch of days, and maybe some of them people who don't know me." Anyway, point being I got to meet so many people in Syracuse and it was so nice. It was so nice to meet all of you.
Chris:        Thank you to the people who brought me things. Thank you to the people that had kind words to say about the show. Someone brought me some homemade toys featuring Wolverine and Night Crawler of the X-Men. Also, here's a first, because we continued the Beautiful Anonymous tradition of huggers. We got some huggers in this gang. A lot of you guys are huggers out there. You want hugs, and I'm happy to give you hugs. You're always so nice about it. You go, "I listen to Beautiful Anonymous. I really need a hug." What a nice thing. I don't ever mind that, if I'm sitting there trying hustle, sell my pre-orders and my new book, which is out by the way, the pre-orders. You can get the pre-orders. It's out in October. You get the pre-order now. Who cares? Anyway.
Chris:        Here's a first, someone approaches me. She goes, "Hey, I brought something for you to sign." I'm thinking, "She's going to bring a copy of my record out. Maybe my other book out." Nope. For the first time every ladies and gentlemen Syracuse New York, I signed a box of Thomas's English muffins; this thing has gotten larger than life itself. Signing, I'm going out on the road, telling jokes, signing boxes of English Muffins, and they said ... I thought my dreams could never come true. Then they did; who knew?
Chris:        I'm always plugging shows on here, because I'm going out a bunch. I tell you, I don't have anything coming up pressingly. I will say, if you're in New York, my New Yorkers, my hometown, my home base, my people, I'm doing a full hour comedy at the Fat Black Pussycat Lounge. The comedy cellar owns it, it's a great space, great environment for comedy, it's only 70 sets. Five dollar tickets! I said, "You keep them cheap, I'm going to get my people in." Haven't really plugged it online yet. I'm going to let this episode drop first, so if you're a New Yorker, you want to come see it, I'm letting this hit.
Chris:        I won't even be tweeting this out until later today, maybe later, let the Beautiful Anonymous fans have the first crack at these sweet-ass five dollar tickets, if you want, comedycellar.com. All the other dates are at chrisgeth.com. That's all the shilling.
Chris:        Last week's episode I cry on the toilet. It's funny, the feedback on that one, so nice. I will say two things that jumped out. One guy who was like, "Hey why did you name the episode that?" He's like, "That wasn't a thing about you crying on the toilet. It's usually ..." I'm not going to lie, that seems like a title that's going to get people to click baby. I would download a thing about crying on the toilet. But Jared and I text about it. Here's some behind the scenes info. You guys like the behind the scenes info. Jared generally picks the names of the episodes, because he takes the audio, he edits them, and then things jump out.
Chris:        Very often I don't even know what they're called until they go up. Then every once in a while I get to put some input in. He said, "I think this is the funniest option." I said, "Yeah, who cares. I cried on the toilet that day, and I talked about it. Let's go with it." Behind the scenes, here throwing Jared under the bus.
Chris:        Hey this week's episode, really really interesting situation. A lot of you guys remember, we did an episode, I think it was for New Years. It was our New Year's episode. People called in and got like one minute at a time. Someone got back through. We heard the one minute preview on the New Year's show, and then this caller got back through. You might remember the bullet points of the minute long call. It said grandmother who's only 39 years old. This is someone who I tell you, I loved this call. She's got such a great attitude, such a great spirit, such a great energy, and I loved it.
Chris:        She was able to tell us her whole life, kind of like this math problem. Not problem in a problematic way, but in a way where we were like, "How does the logic on that work?" The math of her grandkids' age, and her age, and her grandkids' mom's age. You just hear, and you're like, "wait, what?" Fascinating story. She shared the whole thing with us, and she was so cool. Also stopped half way through to ask me a bunch of question, which I thought was very adorable, but I hope you guys enjoyed it, because I'm slightly embarrassed it.
Chris:        The grandma, our 39 year old grandma did follow up afterwards, and wanted just us to share, and I think this is totally fair. Just wanted me to know. Hi Chris, grandma here. Excited, also terrified my episode is coming up next week. After we got off the phone started thinking about our conversation. Started thinking about how my son's girlfriend would feel if she heard the episode. I remember saying some nice things about her. I wondered if it would come off that I was making fun of her, because of her age. Hoping it would be understandable from my perspective that initially it was quite a shock to hear they were dating, especially when I first made the call during the New Year's episode when the information was still fresh.
Chris:        If you hadn't recorded the into yet, hope you could add some information that's very important for me for people to hear. Getting to know her as a person has been a beautiful experience. She's kind, and compassionate, becoming such a great mother, and such a beautiful soul. I feel so luck, and privileged to be able to welcome her as part of our family. Even though our family situation is unconventional, I'm so happy life ended up this way. She said so many things like that in the episode, but wanted to reiterate them, because as you will very soon hear this is one of the sweetest, most giving people I've talked to in life, let alone on this show.
Chris:        To our 39 year old grandmother I figured I'd just read word for word, everybody listening I think is going to tell right away that you love your kid, you love your grandkid, and you love your grand kid's mom. It's so nice of you to reach out. Happy to put that out there to help soothe the nerves, but you got nothing to worry about. You're the nicest, you're the best. Loved this call. You're going to love it too. Can't wait to see what you think in the Facebook community. Talk to you soon.
automated:        Thank you for calling Beautiful / Anonymous. A beeping noise will indicate when you're on the show with the host.
Caller:        Hello.
Chris:        Hello.
Caller:        Hi.
Chris:        How are you?
Caller:        I'm great, how are you doing today?
Chris:        How am I doing? I'm feeling okay. I just went today, emptied out my office from the TV show. That's what I did with the first half of my day. But I'll tell you what ...
Caller:        Wow.
Chris:        Hard to be said when you get to come in, and follow it up with the greatest gig in the world, Beautiful Anonymous.
Caller:        It's so true right? I mean ...
Chris:        I'm lucky son of a bitch.
Caller:        How amazing is it to be able to ... Yes it's so amazing to be able to talk to people like this, and make such a drastic I don't know. What's the word I'm looking for? Not improvement, but just an impact on peoples' lives.
Chris:        Well that's nice.
Caller:        Pretty awesome.
Chris:        I just feel lucky. Get to talk to people, and that's my gig? Just get to talk to nice people like you.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        That's the dream. That's the dream. How about you? How are you doing?
Caller:        Oh my gosh. Well pretty excited right now. Wow. What a week I've been having. Yeah I mean I guess if I think about this, like I've always thought about all the things that I would say if I ever got on. Then I'd would want to keep things happy, and exciting, and joke around, and have a great time with you, because I think we could totally do that, and we can. On the other hand I've been having a week.
Chris:        Okay. Okay.
Caller:        I guess I can just tell you a little bit about that, and then we can discuss that, and then move on.
Chris:        We get to all ... Should I point out maybe ... I think Jared told me ... I think you and I have spoken before, but very briefly is this true?
Caller:        This is so correct, and I'm so excited about this.
Chris:        You were one of the callers, we did an episode ... What was it? For the New Year's or the hot New Year's right? We had people just call in for one minute ...
Caller:        It was.
Chris:        Yeah, and a whole bunch of people got through.
Caller:        I got to speak with you for one minute.
Chris:        What a funny thing.
Caller:        I know right. I mean this is pretty awesome. I get to speak with you twice in my life. Pretty cool.
Chris:        Remind me what was your resolution? Which one were you?
Caller:        Okay, so my resolution was that my son had just told me the month before that he was going to be having a baby, and that I was ... I had just turned 39.
Chris:        Yes.
Caller:        I was going to be a grandma. That there was some interesting circumstances surrounding the pregnancy, and all of that. My son is 23, and his girlfriend is now 43, which means she's older than me. Having a hard time kind of trying to wrap my head around that.
Chris:        I am sorry to laugh, but yeah that's ... Age is just a number in your house?
Caller:        So true. You know what? I feel like my life has just flipped around 180 degrees since that phone call.
Chris:        Okay, I don't want to limit it to that. There's so many questions obviously. But first things first, is everybody healthy? Is everybody healthy and happy and all that?
Caller:        Everything is so wonderful Chris. I am so happy. We are all so lucky. Everything is amazing. The baby is so beautiful, and I am so in love with that little baby.
Chris:        That's awesome.
Caller:        You know, I didn't know how I was going to feel.
Chris:        Yeah, because again just to reiterate, just to make sure I have all my numbers in a row. Your 23 year old son had a baby with a 43 year old woman, and you are 39.
Caller:        Yes, correct.
Chris:        Damn, damn.
Caller:        Right I'm like, "Oh my gosh. I wonder how many times in history of life this has happened." I am sure it has happened.
Chris:        I'm sure.
Caller:        I'm sure this is a thing.
Chris:        Maybe it's been a couple hundred years. Seems like a thing that used to happen more back in the day. Wow. You tell me where you want to start. We can talk about that, or anything else. You had also said you were having a week. Whatever you want to talk about you let me know. I'm going to bring that back up though.
Caller:        Yeah, I know, I know we have to go there. Okay let me just tell you about my week, and then we can move on. My dad three weeks ago, I got a phone call that he was in the emergency room, and that he had had a bleed in his brain. It's this genetic condition that we both share. It's actually ... Oh my gosh this is a whole other thing that they've been able to track this genetic mutation back to the 1500s with Hispanics in New Mexico. It's like this very niche genetic mutation. Then when I found out about it I was like, "Oh my gosh I'm like a Teenage Mutant Turtle." It's pretty awesome. Means I'm a mutant. Got this mutation.
Caller:        It's been passed along for generations, and generations. My grandma had it, my dad had it. I have it, and now my son has it, because he also got DNA tested. It's this mutation that causes lesions in the brain. Sometimes those lesions bleed. When there's a bleed then you get effects that can range anywhere from a headache to essentially a stroke. Seizures all of that fun stuff.
Chris:        Wow. I'm so sorry.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah well that was a whole another ... When I found out ... I found out about that I had that mutation when I was I think about 30. That was some stuff trying to wrap my head around mortality, and life, and what it all meant. My dad had a bleed, and this one was fairly severe this time. It caused him to be hospitalized, and he doesn't really remember. His memory is completely affected. I could tell something, and five minutes later he'll forget that what we're talking about, or that we've had a conversation the day before about something. Not only that, but he can't sit up. He can't walk. He's been in the hospital, and doing physical therapy, and rehab, and stuff for the last three weeks.
Caller:        He finally gets to go home today, but he's going home with 24 hour care now. We have to help him to the bathroom, and get in the bed, and all of that. It's just going to be a completely life altering thing.
Chris:        I'm so sorry.
Caller:        I'm hoping that it's temporary.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah. That's been my week.
Chris:        Yeah, I mean that's brutal to see. Anytime you have a loved one deal with a medical condition it's brutal, and I would have to imagine not to be morbid, but also knowing that it's a condition you share. That must just be like an extra just sobering thing to see.
Caller:        Yes it's so true, because it happened to my grandma when she was fairly young, and she lived a good probably 15 years in a wheelchair. My dad had to take care of her. I think that's probably been something that's weighed on my mind a lot, and weighed on his mind a lot. Now I'm sure weighing on my son's mind a lot, and then he just had a baby. Then there's that thing that there is a 50% probability that now this terrible thing has been passed on to beautiful baby as well. Anyway don't really want to think about that, but.
Chris:        Yeah of course I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Caller:        It is sobering when you think about, yeah the future and what life holds for you in the future.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That's a hell of a week. Well I hope to provide some distraction in the middle of what sounds like a rough week.
Caller:        Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
Chris:        She's 43. So she's 43.
Caller:        Yes, let's go back to that topic.
Chris:        What's that conversation like? When your son is like, "I want you to meet my girlfriend. She graduated college while you were in high school." What's that like?
Caller:        It was the most awkward meeting of a person that I have ever had. I feel like I'm a real people person. I think I can get a long with a lot of people. I'm like, "Oh my gosh what do I do? She's going to come over, what do I say?" She came over, and I tried my best to be nice, and so welcoming. Tried to just really be empathetic, and loving. She turned out to be a beautiful, very warm person.
Chris:        That's very nice. What stage ... Were they just telling you, "Hey we're dating, and you want to meet someone in a sense." Or was it, "Hey this is going to be the mother of your grandchild, and we got to own up to it." What stage did you learn about this? I'm glad you still find it amusing. Are they married? That your daughter in law is four years older than you.
Caller:        How do I even say that. That's going to be so weird. They're not married yet. I'll have to get to that bridge when I'll get there. I guess cross that bridge when I get there.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        This is crazy right? He tells me, I think it was probably in June. No he doesn't even tell me. I see it on his Facebook status. It says he's in a relationship. I'm like, "Oh okay. I guess he'll tell me about it eventually." In July he says, "Oh by the way I have this girlfriend." I had promised him a trip to San Diego for his birthday. He was turning 23. He's like, "I want to bring my girlfriend on this trip to San Diego with me." I said, "Oh okay. Well sure. Go have a good time, see you later."
Caller:        They go on this vacation for the weekend, and they go have a good time, or whatever. Fast forward, he slowly, but sure spending more time at her house. Then he's eventually moving all of his stuff over there. Not official or anything, but he's barely coming home at this point.
Chris:        He lives with you at this point.
Caller:        He was living with me, yeah. Slowly he's just not coming home very much. Then I'm sitting there and I saw the daughter, and she's 15, and she does a lot of theater, and dance and stuff. She's getting ready to perform White Christmas, which I had never seen. Didn't know anything about it. Apparently there's a movie. I'm like, "All right." It's right before Thanksgiving, and I say, "Okay, I'm going to sit down and watch this movie. I have free time. I'm really excited because I get to see the movie, and it's getting me in the spirit for the holidays, and I get to watch my daughter perform."
Caller:        Half way through the movie, and he comes in the house. I'm like, "Oh hi, nice to see you." He says, "I've been trying to figure out a way to tell you this, and I don't really know how to tell you, so I'm just going to show you a picture." He showed me a picture, and it's an ultrasound picture.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        And me having two babies. I know that you have to be a certain stage in your pregnancy. I know you did an ultrasound at two months, but this was not a two month ultrasound picture.
Chris:        Had you met his girlfriend yet?
Caller:        I met her one time. She was nice, but I knew nothing about her.
Chris:        I tell you, I'm 38 years old. I've dated people throughout my life. I've met many a parent. I'm trying to think what would happen if I started dating someone right now, and went to meet their parent who was 34 years old. That would be the equivalent for me right? That would be the equivalent, because I'm 38.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Four years younger than me.
Caller:        Look I know I started super young.
Chris:        You did.
Caller:        I had my son when I was 16. I know this is partially my fault.
Chris:        Well it's not ... I mean you're also laughing about it. Here's the thing. You're laughing about it, and showing so much joy, and I'm laughing about it too. I hope that we're laughing at it together, and you're not one of these people who does so to just cover a deep well of fear, and pain, which sometimes that happens out there.
Caller:        No, no.
Chris:        You seem like a very well adjusted person.
Caller:        No I try, I try, yeah, no I'm not holding any fear, or pain, or anything. I think I've resigned to thinking that whatever is going to happen with their relationship is going to happen. I don't really have any say in what happens with that relationship. They may get married. They may separate. I don't know, but I feel like she's a great enough person that even if they do separate that I'll still be able to see my grandson.
Chris:        Then you and her can hang out.
Caller:        Totally. I've already tried. I'm like, "Okay can I be your friend now?" I mean it's a little bit selfish for selfish reason, because I just want to hang out with my baby, but she's a nice person, I like her.
Chris:        That's nice. You're 16 when you had your son?
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        What's that like?
Caller:        Yeah. Had to tell my parents that I was pregnant when I was 15. That was a fun conversation. My parents were divorced. My dad already had another woman in his life. A whole another topic. Told my mom first. She actually came in the room. I was probably being really dramatic, and crying on the floor, or something like that. Boyfriend had just told me essentially like, "Yeah you're pregnant, but our relationship isn't going to work, and I don't want to be with you." Type of thing. You do that when you're 15.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah.
Caller:        Young and dumb. I think I was on the floor crying, and my mom came in. She knew that this was a legitimate like, I am in deep pain right now kind of cry. She was like, "What's going on?" I said, "I'm pregnant." She said, "No." She ran out of the room. She ran to her room, and slammed the door, and then she's sobbing. It was that night, and then the next day she woke up and she was like, "Okay, you're going to have to tell your dad."
Chris:        She made you ...
Caller:        She called him, and said ... Yeah.
Chris:        Wow. She ran out of the room, which I have to imagine is the nightmare reaction.
Caller:        Yes.
Chris:        The nightmare reaction that you are praying doesn't happen, and then she says, "You call your dad."
Caller:        Oh my gosh yes.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        She told my dad that I had something to tell him. He went and picked me up from school. Mind you I went to an all girls Catholic school.
Chris:        I assumed, I assumed.
Caller:        He picked me up from school and he says, "Your mom says you have something to tell me." I said, "Yeah I'd rather just wait until we get to the house so she's there, so I can tell you with her there." Because I thought for sure he was going to beat me. My dad was strict. He was the mean one in the set of parents. He was the one that enforced all of the rules. I was like, "I'm going to die right now." He just grabbed my hand and he said, "Listen, I'm in a pretty good mood right now. You should probably just go ahead and tell me while I'm in a good mood."
Chris:        Okay. Sure dad, okay.
Caller:        Then I'm crying, and shaky and I said, "Okay, I'm pregnant." He just continues to hold my hand and he said, "Okay, we're going to get through this together, and we're going to help you, and I'm going to help you do the best that we can. I think I'm going to make a pretty good grandfather."
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        I was just completely floored.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Dad stepped up.
Caller:        My parents were so amazing. They helped me so much. That was my junior year, and then I finished out my junior year. Over the summer I have my son. I was lucky enough back then ... I think teen pregnancy must have been more of a thing back then, because there was these teen parent centers. I went to this ... It was like a continuation for ... But they had this one that was just for teen moms, and they had a nursery. It was more like independent study. I was able to finish up the rest of my credits for my senior year in just a couple of months, and then I applied to my local state college, and I got into college that January of my senior year. I took night classes, and they helped me take care of the baby while I was in school. It worked out really well.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        Pretty amazing.
Chris:        It sounds like your family had your back. It sounds like it didn't slow you down all that much. Let's go ahead and pause this call, because we got some ads coming up. I'm going to go ahead and say I love this caller. I love her energy. I love her story. I love her openness, and her honest. We're going to get back to that, but in the meantime though do check out the ads that we have. Use the promo codes if anything appeals to you. It helps Beautiful Anonymous when you do so. We'll be right back with more phone call after this.
Chris:        Today's show is sponsored by Talk Space. The online therapy company that lets you message a licensed therapist from anywhere at anytime. I know your life is busy.

Chris:        All you need is a computer with an internet connection, or the Talk Space mobile app, you can improve your mental health.

Chris:        Thanks again to everybody who sponsors our show. Not let's get back to the phone call. Had your back. It sounds like it didn't slow you down all that much.
Caller:        Yeah it really didn't. Other than I wanted ... When I first started college I had these crazy expectation that I was going to be a neurosurgeon. I think probably because of all of the stuff that had happened with my family, and my grandma. I knew that my dad still had the condition, because he ... When I was four he was paralyzed from another bleed, and had to relearn to walk, and everything again. I was just like, "I'm going to be a neurosurgeon, and cure my family's ailments, and had all these big dreams. Then I got to college, and I was like, "Yeah that's not going to happen."
Chris:        It seems difficult. I mean that seems like it would be ...
Caller:        It seems I don't have the competitive...
Chris:        I was going to say that seems like a difficult path to walk, whether or not you have a child. Neurosurgery is a competitive one no matter what.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        What did you wind up studying?
Caller:        I learned all about biology. I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I just knew that I had this biology teacher in high school that really inspired me, and I really loved learning about wildlife, and nature, and stuff. I was like, "Okay, I'll just go study biology, and then ..." It took seven and a half years to graduate, but I graduated ...
Chris:        That's okay.
Caller:        ... And messed around a lot with a lot of different... I took classes on fish, and mammals, and birds, and insects, and aquatic insects, and learned all about animal behavior, and then got a job that has nothing to do with any of that.
Chris:        As one does. As one does.
Caller:        You know how that goes.
Chris:        You have another child as well.
Caller:        I do. She's 15.
Chris:        15, so that was eight year ... That was when you were 24?
Caller:        Yeah I think I made this a habit that getting pregnant in my senior year. Got pregnant in my senior year of college.
Chris:        You did, and ...
Caller:        It's like a graduation.
Chris:        Can I ask what the circumstances of this one were?
Caller:        Going back to my son, and his father, and that fun relationship. We were off and on until I was about 18. Until my son was about two, and then college, and then college. I think it was in my ... I guess it had to have been my junior year in college I met my husband, because we had an English class together. We just became really good friends, and would laugh, and joke a lot. After about a year it was like, "Hey you know what? I really like this guy." We started dating. I don't know timeline is very blurry to me. I mean I guess I was there for seven and a half years.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Junior year probably doesn't mean junior year. At some point we were dating, and then probably a couple of years later I found myself pregnant. We had the baby, and then we got married when my daughter was a year old. We've been together now for 14 years.
Chris:        That's beautiful, congratulations.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        Can I ask ...
Caller:        Thank you. My son got ... Yeah.
Chris:        Can I ask when you're now approaching college graduation, and you call your parents again and say, "Hey, I have some news." What's that like? What's that round two like?
Caller:        They're like, "What is happening in your life?" I said, "It's in my son's name. Son is going to have a sister, and be a big brother." They're like, "What?" Yeah I'm going to have a baby. They're like, "Okay. Are you happy about this?" Of course I'm happy. They're like, "Okay we're happy for you."
Chris:        Really, because I was anticipating you get back on the phone with your dad and he's like, "Come the fuck on. What?"
Caller:        I mean I'm sure when he hung up the phone ... I'm sure those were his exact thoughts. He was going to give me a graduation trip to Hawaii when I graduated from college. Then I was pregnant, and then he was like, "So the trip is canceled, great you're not going to Hawaii."
Chris:        You have a pretty remarkable family?
Caller:        Yeah, yeah. My mom passed away about 11 years ago now.
Chris:        I'm sorry.
Caller:        She had breast cancer. She had breast cancer for about three years. One day she showed up at my house, and she came in wearing one earring, and her shoes were untied. I was like, "Mom what's going on?" She said, "Oh yeah, I don't know. I think my earring fell out a few days ago." I said, "You've been walking around for one earring for like three days?" She's like, "Oh yeah I guess." When she went home that day and she got lost, she couldn't remember how to get to her house from my house.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        She called me and she said, "Oh yeah it's funny. I got lost. I don't know I finally had to call someone, and figure out how to get home." I said, "Mom you need to call your doctor immediately, and we need to go see your doctor tomorrow." It turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain, and she lived for about 11 months after that. She moved in with me. I was an only child, so I had to figure out how to sell her car, and sell her car, and pay all of her bills, and get everything in order. Then we went to hospice. That was really great. I think someone else had talked about hospice in another episode. I wanted to echo how wonderful hospice volunteers, and hospice nurses are. They're just amazing. They were so wonderful to my family.
Caller:        About a year after she died I went and signed up to be a hospice volunteer too, and did that for a couple of years. I had some really amazing experiences with people that were in hospice, and just chatting, and tell me their life story, and getting to listen to them was really inspiring.
Chris:        I say this very genuinely. How are you so positive? How are you so good natured?
Caller:        I don't know. Probably go home, and cry every night ...
Chris:        Yeah we've been laughing the whole time. Every story you tell me is actually a story that is fraught with real toughness. Your stress, or anxiety, or pain.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah.
Chris:        You've lived through a lot in 39 years.
Caller:        I know it's true. It's crazy. Yeah, and every day I just have to wake up and be like, "All right what's life throwing at me today?" Because man I've had to roll with some punches.
Chris:        You say it in that, a tone of voice that's more positive than I've ever attained in 38 years on earth. Yeah. What's life going to throw me today? I've had to roll with some punches.
Caller:        Yeah it's so true. You can either just cry about it, or laugh about it. I have to laugh. I have to be like, "Oh my gosh, this is so comical. How much worse can things get sometimes?" You learn, and you grow. I don't know I guess you just become a better person with every obstacle that you have to overcome.
Chris:        How is your husband doing?
Caller:        He is so wonderful. He was definitely my rock through everything that happened with my mom. Just completely being there for me, but not being intrusive. I guess sometimes if things that are hard that are happening in my life, then I kind of tend to shut down a little bit with my family, just because I guess I don't want to be an emotional wreck in front of them. I have to be strong, and be the mom that has everything together. I'm going to get this. Sorry, I'm going to get myself together.
Chris:        No you don't have to apologize. You don't have to be strong around me, I don't even know you.
Caller:        Anyway he knows when to ask questions, and when to back off. He can dig in a little bit and say, "How are you feeling?" I can tell him as much as I'm able to tell him at that moment. He's like, "Okay." And he'll just hug me, and hold me, and hold my hand. Sometimes that's all you need.
Chris:        Yeah, that's pretty good. You wound up with a good one?
Caller:        I really did.
Chris:        I'm glad you didn't stick with that shit head from high school.
Caller:        It's so true. Oh my gosh we celebrated so hard when my son turned 18.
Chris:        Oh really?
Caller:        I was like, "We don't have to deal with him anymore." ...
Chris:        That stayed.
Caller:        He doesn't even know.
Chris:        That just remained a headache for 18 years?
Caller:        It really did. There's just some things that you don't really think about, how much you have to deal with somebody that you really don't want in your life. But when you have a kid, it complicates things. His family is really wonderful though.
Chris:        That ...
Caller:        Yeah his parents are amazing, and they were so nice, and they were so involved in my son's life throughout his full life. He had such a good relationship with them, and my husband's parents, and my son's dad parents. They all get along so well. We had these family get togethers where everyone is in the same room, laughing, and joking, and nobody is mad at each other. Even through the times that my son's father and I hated each other. We could still be civil to each other, and our families will get together, and still have a really good time together.
Chris:        Yeah, yeah.
Caller:        That's pretty important.
Chris:        Absolutely, absolutely. I mean you've had a life that has had a lot of chaos, and it sounds like you've had to really learn more than most how to find the level head inside that chaos.
Caller:        Yeah absolutely.
Chris:        Your dad, he's suffering right now, and I'm really sorry about that. How long ago did this happen? Did he get to hang out with your grandkid at all, before the latest round of incidents?
Caller:        Yeah this is fresh, three weeks ago.
Chris:        Three weeks. That must be cool to be a great granddad. That must be a cool thing to see your dad get to hit that level.
Caller:        Yeah. That's really nice. My grandson will be ... What's the date? I guess maybe we're not suppose to deal with the baby.
Chris:        You can see the date.
Caller:        I think my grandson will be ... What is the date today?
Chris:        It's June 8th, It's June 8th, 2018.
Caller:        Okay, thank you. My grandson will be three months old in two days.
Chris:        Wow.
Caller:        Yeah. He's beautiful.
Chris:        What month were you born in?
Caller:        I was born in December. I'm a Sagittarius.
Chris:        You were born in December, which I believe means you're five months older than me, or 17 months.
Caller:        Oh really?
Chris:        Which one would it be? You're 39? You turn 40 in December...
Caller:        You just turned 38 right?
Chris:        I just turned 38.
Caller:        I turn 40 this year.
Chris:        You do, so what's that mean?
Caller:        I think that means 17 months.
Chris:        17 months. I'm not good with the math, and whatnot.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        You're 17 months older than me. You just said the sentence, "My grandson is three months old."
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        From my perspective, no offense, I think you could tell I'm not out to offend you. That's bonkers. That's bonkers.
Caller:        That sometimes really does seem to amaze a lot of people. That is true.
Chris:        You also can't judge someone based on their voice, but you sound very youthful. You don't have a grandma energy. I'm sure you get this a lot.
Caller:        Yeah, yeah. Sorry there's a lot of motorcycles going by. Yes. I feel like I am a very youthful person.
Chris:        You're young to have a 15 year old daughter.
Caller:        I know.
Chris:        You have a three month old grandchild.
Caller:        Right? So that's usually how people lead in, because my daughter is still with me a lot of the times. They're like, "Wait, you can't have a 15 year old daughter." I'm like, "Wait there's more."
Chris:        Check this out.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        That's a cool party trick.
Caller:        Yeah right. All right. You know what? I always thought that when I got on, I was going to have a list of questions for you. Of course I can't remember most of them right now, but I still have questions.
Chris:        I'll answer any question you want, even though you have the most fascinating life in the world. Wait, pause. Questions about me. Who wants questions about ... I guess we're going to answer questions about me when we get back guys. This caller seems convinced that this is what Beautiful Anonymous beauty wants the behind scenes info on me, and my life. We'll get back to that, and then also back to her very, very fascinating life after these advertisements.
Chris:        Hello everybody it's Chris. Okay you can tell already this is not a usual ad, because it's me, it's me talking to you. We'll set aside some time, because they want us to do a little primer. They're asking all the shows. How can I support the show? A lot of people ask that about all the shows here at Earwolf. I'm going to take some time to tell you what you can do to support Beautiful Anonymous. There's a lot you can do. Any one of these things helps. First of all you heard me talk about it. We got Beautiful Anonymous the Facebook community.
Chris:        This thing is almost 29,000 people strong. It's a really amazing addition to the show. I always say ... Whenever I meet someone on the road who listens to the show. It's so crazy to me that it's just me one on one with a stranger, but it's a huge community that surrounds it. The epicenter of this show, the shows community is that Facebook group. Beautiful Anonymous the community. Join up, have fun.
Chris:        Here's another thing you do. You go leave a review in Apple Podcast. I have not shelled this for you guys really in years, but it helps so much when you do it. Go check it out.

Chris:        Thanks to all of our sponsors who bring this show to the world. Now let's get back to the phone call. I'll answer any question you want, even though you have the most fascinating life in the world.
Caller:        I think sometimes I'm like, "Listeners of the show, they get pretty excited when they hear stuff about you too."
Chris:        Hey this is your call. I'm down for whatever. I'm an open book everybody knows that.
Caller:        You know what? I was reading ... Congratulations on your new book coming out. Is it officially out yet?
Chris:        Nope October 16th hits the street. Get that copy. It's called Lose Well. We're going to have some promo codes for Beautiful Anonymous listeners, really try ... I'm at a point in my career where I'm very comfortable, and secure, but I do think it would just be funny if I could become a New York Times best seller. That would be hilarious.
Caller:        that would be amazing.
Chris:        If some schmuck from North Jersey gets on the bestseller list, I'm going to ask the Beautiful Anonymous listeners to help me gain the system on that on, because I got some ideas.
Caller:        You know we're all behind you.
Chris:        Thank you so much, thank you so much.
Caller:        Reading your first book I was wondering about this crazy person from your neighborhood. I forget his name, but he has some crazy name.
Chris:        We called him Kuzo in the book.
Caller:        Kuzo yes.
Chris:        That guy, the guy on the moped.
Caller:        I really wanted more, yes.
Chris:        Really, I didn't. Growing up I wanted no more of that maniac. No he's a sweet kid. What a funny thing this way. That was my second book. I actually wrote ... A lot of people don't know I actually wrote another book before that, but it was through a company that I worked for in New York, but yes.
Caller:        What was it?
Chris:        It was called Weird New York. I worked at a magazine for many years called Weird New Jersey.
Caller:        Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I did know this.
Chris:        Yeah, and they expanded a book series, and they had me write weird New York for them. Then I wrote another book. That was my first personal book that came out in 2011. One of the first chapters... It's like the first, or second chapter. It was about this guy in my neighborhood. He used to ride a moped around, and torment to us. It was nuts. It was nuts, but it's very north Jersey in the 80s, very 1980s, early 1990s north Jersey story of some kid with no supervision who rides around on a moped, and no adults ever step in and say, "Don't tear thorn branches off bushes, and chase the other kids around on your moped, and whip them with the thorn branches. Don't do that." They just let us live in chaos at all times.
Chris:        I wish I could say his real name, but it would be bad. I think Cuzo is a very good approximation his real name. Man this kid was ... I looked him up. I looked him up on Facebook. He's one of those guys ...
Caller:        On Facebook?
Chris:        Yeah I found him on Facebook. I was like, "Holy shit. People like this are alive. People like this just grow old just like the rest of us." These weird cartoon characters from our past, that you grow up, they were these larger than life guys, and he just works a gig, and he has a family, and good on him. I have no idea if he's heard of it. I have no idea if he would even remember who I was. He's probably remember my brother more than me, but yeah he was a true crackpot. He used to drive a car when he was 13. He just drive around in a car. We're all like, "Where did he get a car?" He wouldn't tell us.
Chris:        I had no idea to this day how old he was. I just knew he was older than me, and he was terrifying. He had multiple motor vehicles.
Caller:        It seems like a scene from a movie.
Chris:        My whole God damn life, oh God damn ... But I'm also Irish, so I know how to spin a good yarn out of it too.
Caller:        Yeah. I don't think I ever had anyone like that in my life. That story really stood out to me.
Chris:        Oh because your life hasn't been like a movie at all. Nothing cinematic about your life story.
Caller:        Yeah. I have to ask myself all the time. Am I really crazy in life, or is this just normal things that happen to all kinds of people? I don't know.
Chris:        Yeah, your life is like a movie. I've never had anything happen like that. I'm like, "Oh really?" Your grandchild's mom is older than you. I think neither one of us needs to be pointing fingers at who has the more unusual life. Okay my friend.
Caller:        You're 100% correct.
Chris:        You are living in a family that is, on the surface a mathematical impossibility. Let's not start pointing fingers friend.
Caller:        What I meant was, I never had anyone that terrorized my neighborhood.
Chris:        We had that. That was a big thing in Jersey. It's funny, because on some level they were just bullies, but it was also like a big pissing contest, who could be the craziest one.
Caller:        Yeah.
Chris:        There were a lot of crazy people in my neighborhood.
Caller:        Wow.
Chris:        Yeah. That was your question. That was the big question.
Caller:        That was like number one on my list of things to ask you, that's correct. Number two, you talk a lot about cabinet, door staying open, and draws. Is this correct?
Chris:        Yeah it was in the HBO special.
Caller:        You have a thing about ...
Chris:        You're the nicest person I've ever talked to. You're the nicest human being I've ever talked to. Everyone listening will probably agree with me. You're so nice, and all these little details about my life, it's making me feel good, and here it is when we still have 17 minutes left for you to tell your story. The cabinet doors, and draws, yeah.
Caller:        No way. Is that mainly feels like? Wow, you know people have aesthetics in their home, like their decor, and are they messy people, or are they clean people? Are they clean freaks? Are there piles everywhere?
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        I think in my house, the front of the house looks good, and there's never any messes. But my closet is my secret lair, where it's just like this enormous mountain. That's where all my chaos lies. Yeah I wanted to know what the aesthetic in your household is like?
Chris:        You're an adorable grandma. Everyone is going to lose their fucking minds in this episode. You're a grandma, and you're being real adorable, and everybody is about to lose their fucking minds. Because you tell your own story, and now you're asking me this weird behind the scenes questions that no one saw coming. I got to tell you it's quite charming. You want to know what is the aesthetic in my home is the thing we're talking about on the show today Jared. Let's see. I'm a mess. I tell you I work really hard to be a good husband. I will tell you if you ask my wife what the worst thing about living with me is, it's little piles of shit everywhere.
Chris:        I wouldn't say I'm a dirty person, but I'm a boy for sure if that makes sense.
Caller:        Yeah it does.
Chris:        I've never cohabited before my wife, lived with someone else. I will tell you you just learn that boys are dirty. We grow up dirty. I only had a brother, and we were dirty, and we grew up down the hill, which is not ... You can tell from the name, that's not the clean part of town. It's down the hill. My parents are very neat people. My mom is an extremely orderly person. We grew up in a very clean house. I think my brother, and I we were just kind of like brothers, rough and tumble, and I think I'm clean. Then my wife will like ... I'll do a dish. This happened again yesterday, yesterday. I did the dishes, and then my wife picks up one of the bowls and is like, "Clean this again." I get all offended where I'm like, "Don't talk to me like I'm a child."
Chris:        Then she's like, "Look at it." I pick it up, and it's just covered in shit. I'm like, "Okay I'll clean it again, because I'm a boy." We have two children. In the neighborhood we live in all the buildings, they have these buildings, and one of the features the neighborhood is known for is there's two ... There's a standup shower, and a tub shower in every bathroom. For some reason that's just how this neighborhood is built. She has her shower, and I have my shower. You would know instantly who was who's if you walked into our bathroom.
Caller:        Wait like in the same bathroom, or two separate bathroom?
Chris:        Same bathroom. No one bathroom, two showers. Yeah.
Caller:        Wow.
Chris:        It's a weird feature of Jackson Heights Queens. The neighborhood is known for it. We thought about getting one of them turned into a closet. The stand up shower we were going to turn into a closet. Every contractor we talked to said, "No this neighborhood is famous for these. Don't do it. People love these."
Caller:        Oh right, right, right.
Chris:        But yeah I'm a mess, I'm a mess. My wife leaves everything open. She will sometimes get in clutter. There are times where sometimes there will be a lot of clutter in our house that is Hallie's, but here's never filth. I am the source of all the filth. When she'll point at a thing and be like ... She'll point at my shower door and be like, "There's stuff growing at the bottom. Clean off the stuff that's growing at least." I'm like, "Yeah." The worst part about being married to me is that I'm the boy who doesn't ...
Caller:        That's okay.
Chris:        I'm not trying to be a jerk. It's not that I don't want to clean, and don't want to help, is that I honestly don't see it as much as she does.
Caller:        It's just you, yeah. I understand.
Chris:        What's your next question grandma?
Caller:        What's my next question. I had one.
Chris:        This is really what you planned on doing if you ever gotten through? Is telling me a truncated version of the most fascinating life story, and then asking me what my home aesthetic is?
Caller:        Absolutely 100%. I can talk to you for hours about my life, but I know all about my life. I know it's the same for you. I think listeners would be appreciative of knowing details about you.
Chris:        They're loving it. Some of them have turned it off, I'm not going to lie. Some of them have turned it off. The ones who remain are dancing, are dancing with joy that you're doing this. What else do you got grandma?
Caller:        Oh man, I don't know. I had two other ones, and they disappeared.
Chris:        Two other ones disa ... I guess I can ask you growing up ...
Caller:        Oh, oh, oh I know.
Chris:        Okay, okay, yeah, no, go for it.
Caller:        Okay. You had a recent story about Mike Birbiglia, and the wedding story. Everyone got so excited about your friendship with Mike Birbiglia and that relationship. That was pretty awesome for me, because I wanted to tell you that's how I found you is because I randomly turned out a Netflix special one day, and it was my girlfriend's boyfriend. I was like, "Oh I'm bored. I don't have anything else to do. I'm going to put this on. I have no idea who's excited, and just totally amazed me. I was like, "Wow this guy is really cool. I want to find out more about him." Then I saw you came out with that movie, Don't Think Twice, and you were in it.
Caller:        Then I heard you on NPR, and I was like, "Wow, I have to check out this guy's podcast." And here we are, and here I am today.
Chris:        What's the question?
Caller:        I forgot.
Chris:        What is going on right now? What is happening?
Caller:        My question is that I want to make sure that you guys still have that same level of frame.
Chris:        You want to just check in? You want to call the podcast and use your platform, 100,000 people listening. You want just make sure me and Birbigs are still pals.
Caller:        Yes it's so important.
Chris:        I'm happy to tell we are. I opened for him through all of 2014. It was really eye opening. I learned a lot about how to be a better comedian. I'm not going to lie, I was already pretty good. I was pretty deep in, and I learned a lot from Birbigs that I owe him a lot. Put me in his movie, and really believed in me. Since the movie wrapped, he's a relentlessly busy guy, I'm a relentlessly busy guy. We haven't caught up in person as much as we would like, but we still text all the time, and sometimes we get on the phone like a couple of little chatty Kathy.
Caller:        Oh that's so cute.
Chris:        Is that the answer you were hoping for?
Caller:        Yes I'm glad. I'm glad it wasn't that you got in from a huge fight, and you never spoke to each other again.
Chris:        No it's funny, because I think Mikey and I are both really hard workers. I'm a workaholic. I'm not going to speak for him. Sometimes I think you get people like that, and they can bounce off of each other. But I think we've just always really understood each other. Actually just sent him a copy of my new book where I thanked him in the back. Yeah.
Caller:        That's wonderful. Okay you have a question.
Chris:        Did you find that growing up Hispanic in a Catholic community led to extra judgment based on your early pregnancy? Or you could just ask me more about home décor, whichever one you want.
Caller:        No I think I'm done with the question, yes 100% yes.
Chris:        We're going to just jump back to that? What's your home aesthetic?
Caller:        I thought you wanted me to answer...
Chris:        I did, I'm just kidding. I'm just amazed that we took a 10 to 15 minute rest stop to talk about home décor, and Mike Birbiglia, and then you were totally fine with me asking about the judgment of the Catholic community, go. It must have been brutal.
Caller:        Yes, but I wasn't a super hard core Catholic growing up. Yes there was a lot of talk about me running my life, and never having a shot pursuing my career, I mean my goals, and my career. That my life was just going to turn out to be a mess. I had some ... My life didn't take a straight path. There were a lot of detours along the way. But I think the thing that I remember most was, my mom and I went to my ultrasound when I was five months pregnant, remarks if it was a boy, or a girl, and the remarks that the ultrasound technician were saying to both me and my mom, like really, really rude stuff probably stuck out to me the most. I don't know if she was Hispanic, or Catholic. I just remember she was a person who was passing judgment in a very vocal way.
Chris:        That sucks. I remember once, I had also ... My mom and my aunt listen, who cares. I had a pregnancy scare when I was a freshman in college. My girlfriend in high school, and college. I may have told this story on the show before, I don't know. But we had to go to a drug store to get a pregnancy test, and the person kind of like ticked at us. You know gave us a little bit of that. Gave us a little bit of like glanced at us and was like, "Hmm." I wanted to reach over the counter, and grab the person, and just fling him across the room. I can't imagine ...
Caller:        Isn't that the worst? Because you're feeling ... Well no, there are many people who feel wonderful about going in buying a pregnancy test, because they really want to be pregnant.
Chris:        When you're in a college town, and you're two visibly teenage kids, bite your tongue.
Caller:        Right, then there's the other half that are just ... Like one of the worst times of your life is having to go into a store, and buy a pregnancy test, and praying that it's going to come out negative. Then yeah for people who are like stare at you, and judge you, in that moment it's pretty messed up.
Chris:        Grandma, how did you do it? What's the secret? How did you do this?
Caller:        What did I do?
Chris:        You turned into a positive, warm person who's faced down so much, and still facing down so much. What's the secret?
Caller:        Oh man there's no secret. I'm a very bubbly person I guess maybe can tell, and maybe sometimes I talk a lot. I definitely have my own struggles with anxiety, and depression, absolutely 100%. Therapy, and talking to people, and having a good family support, and have a good friend that I can express all of my worst thoughts to, and not be judged by. That's pretty important I think.
Chris:        You just work as hard as everybody else.
Caller:        One friend I have that I can say ... Yeah I can say all of the terrible things that are on my mind, and he validates them. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, valid, valid question ...
Chris:        No secret, just hard work, and keeping good people around, yeah.
Caller:        Absolutely
Chris:        That's cool.
Caller:        I forgot to tell you another interesting aspect of my life.
Chris:        Oh boy.
Caller:        When I was in college ...
Chris:        What's this going to be?
Caller:        How much time do we have left?
Chris:        Five minutes, and 20 seconds.
Caller:        I feel like I've been talking so much. Okay. When I was in college, one day I came in and this guy that was in my biology class. He had an indent on his face, like on his forehead, and around his nose, and I was like, "Why do you have your indent on your face." He said, "Oh I worked at the corner's office, and I have to wear this head mask thing, same when I taught CSS Stent." I just dropped everything. I was like, "I 100% need to do this right now." He gave me the contact information. I went, and got interviewed, and got accepted. I was an intern at the coroner's office. I got to do autopsies. That was pretty amazing. You start out at B6 stuff right.
Chris:        What are you talking about?
Caller:        I can really gross you out, or I could not.
Chris:        What are you talking about?
Caller:        But then you graduate to the next level. The next level where you're super start autopsy assistant. They give you the bone saw, and then you get to use the scalpel, and then peel back the ... I'm probably grossing a lot of people out.
Chris:        I just threw my glasses for the first time in a while. First time in a long time that the glasses got thrown down on the table.
Caller:        You get to cut a circle on the skull, and then they show you how to extract a brain, and there's a whole technique for it, and then you get to measure it. There's a lot of other really cool stuff that you get to do as an autopsy assistant. That was really cool, but I saw a lot of really messed up stuff also. You have questions.
Chris:        What do you do now?
Caller:        Now I do kind of a boring job.
Chris:        To ask for that.
Caller:        It's not boring for some people. I work in my state's energy industry, and we have this program for clean energy research. I supervise people.
Chris:        That's cool. That's an important thing. My wife is going to love that. My wife is obsessed with the environment. Clean energy is a thing she talks about a lot.
Caller:        Oh that's great, that's good to hear.
Chris:        Yeah.
Caller:        Yeah. We work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and researchers that have new ideas about ways to conserve energy, and make new energy efficient, technologies, and things like that. It is exciting for some people.
Chris:        You know what's cool? You're going to get so much time with your grandkid.
Caller:        I know I'm really excited about that.
Chris:        More than most people.
Caller:        Yeah unless I die tomorrow.
Chris:        Jesus Christ. Try to have a happy, sentimental moment here. Two minutes left, I'm trying to wind us down, stick the landing on something that feels positive, and uplifting, and sentimental.
Caller:        See this is how I deal with life. I know, I know. But I think it stems back to that autopsy internship that I know that like ... .
Chris:        The end of the day it's just some 20 year old intern yanking your brain out of your head with the right hand, while they hold the bone saw in their left hand.
Caller:        Yeah, and oh my gosh. We got to see people who are organ donors. What happens to your body after organ donation, and sometimes they're take out your bone, and your eyeballs, and all of your organs and stuff. You end up really looking like a rag doll. Life is crazy, and I guess if we're winding out, I would just say you should appreciate every waking moment that you have. Like this whole hour that I've just had. It's so amazing. Yeah value it, because you never know when you're going to get a phone call, and something crazy is going to be on the other end of that phone call.
Chris:        100%.
Caller:        You appreciate the small things.
Chris:        We have 45 seconds left. I want to thank you. I can say no exaggeration, this has been one of my favorite calls we've done, and so much to it. Most of all sending love to you and your family, especially your dad.
Caller:        Thank you. I really appreciate it. This has been really great.
Chris:        I've got 25 seconds left if you want to drop any more bombs on the way out the door.
Caller:        I don't think I have any more. Love to you and Hallie, and Jared, and Shannon, and Vacation Jason? I shouldn't end that way....
Chris:        No. Why?
Caller:        Vacation Jason.
Chris:        My enemy.
Caller:        Justin he's a good guy right?
Chris:        Caller thank you. What a great energy you had, and what a fascinating story you had. To hear from somebody who lived a life that I think would have thrown many people for loops, but to hear how positive you are, and how much you've built a life that you have with your family. Inspiring, down right inspiring that you're telling about us it.

Chris:        Next time on Beautiful Anonymous I'm truly touched when a young man who's never really told anybody about his sexuality decides to tell us.
Speaker 4:        I sometimes teach people that being honest with yourself if they're important, and sometimes they don't follow, that in my own way ... When I turned 25, I was like, "I'm going to use this year, and this is the year I think I'm going to come out of the closet."
Chris:        Wow. How's that been going?
Speaker 4:        We are almost at the year mark, and sorry it hasn't happened yet, but I have been really fighting some internal demons with myself. In this last year I was like, "You know what? If I get on, I think this is going to be a really big step for me."
Chris:        That's next time on Beautiful Anonymous.
